            "text": "Hello, I'm a Massachusetts senior looking to apply to Umass Amherst for Astrophysics. My stats are definitely nowhere near great, with a pretty low GPA (2.9) and a mid-SAT score (1220). I've been passionate about Astronomy since I was young, and my ECs/essay heavily reflect that, with me being the president of the Astronomy Club and other things. My essay is about my passion for Astronomy and how I've stuck with it.\n\nAs the title says, I just wanted to know how competitive the Astronomy program is to get into. I know UMass has gotten harder over the years, but it is my top choice, and I would love to know if I even have a slim chance. Thank you so much!",

However, your stats will probably make it difficult to get accepted.\n\nIf you passionately conveyed your interest and commitment to astronomy/astrophysics, I think that would help you a lot. Being the president of an astronomy club is a guaranteed boost.\n\nEither way, I wish you luck and hope you get accepted.",
