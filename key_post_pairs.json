However you will be worked to the ground. \n\nAnd in today\u2019s job market Leetcode is what gives you a job. So juggling extremely hard classes, keeping a good GPA, with Leetcode is no easy task. \n\nOnly come here if you want to work like a dog and truly want to be the best. Source - someone who has had good internships with a high gpa. Most kids here are international so they aren\u2019t grinding Leetcode like that. Also CS here is crazy math heavy and you really gotta be good - unlike most schools where it\u2019s not nearly as hard. \n\nIf I just did school and didn\u2019t have to grind Leetcode I don\u2019t think I would struggle that much. But because like 80-90% of kids are international (do not be misled, this is the truth) they usually are just UCAs, internships in India, and do grad school. So for a domestic student you really gotta grind if you want good internships since you need to balance school with Leetcode",

So not \"just anyone\" was accepted.  241 of those enrolled in CICS.  Average GREs from those who reported scores were 166 Math, 156 Verbal.\n\nThe \"primarily exists to support the PhD program financially\" is a mischaracterization of the situation.  The PhD program is supported through research and university funds being used to provide assistantships to PhD or MS/PhD track students.  MS CS degree candidates who do not have to do research or a masters thesis by policy normally do not get assistantships.  Their tuition is being used to support and fund the MS program.  They can apply for jobs as graders after their first semester, otherwise they are able to work regular student jobs and apply for applicable financial aid to partly pay for the program.",

Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong. Do you happen to know anyone who went on to do their PhD at UMass or another school after completing the MS here? I\u2019ve heard it can be challenging to get into a PhD program without a thesis-based master\u2019s, and I\u2019m also curious if research opportunities are limited for master\u2019s students at UMass.",

I do know that some of the other schools and colleges at UMass do offer a masters degree w/ thesis track and provide some funding to those grad students.\n\nGlancing at the MS CS description it looks like CICS does not specifically have a thesis requirement for their MS CS.  But they do offer options for independent study research or a Masters Project done with one or two professors as either a paper or research.  Possibly contacting the program or others may get you more information on that.  But I personally don't know any recent grads from the CICS programs, the ones I knew were ages ago in the late '80s and early '90s.  The program has changed quite a bit since then.\n\nThe MS/PhD track does mention students getting involved in research from the beginning.  It appears that track uses the initial research to develop into the PhD dissertation.",

International graduates can use something called OPT to legally get a job in the US after graduating from undergrad or graduate academic programs in the US but, after the OPT period expires, a company will need to pay to sponsor a visa for a non-US citizen employee. The process for obtaining that visa can take a long time and is not guaranteed (there are limits to the numbers granted by the US government) and so many companies do not consider non-citizens for their positions.\nThere are plenty of international graduates who do get jobs in the US after completing the MS on CS, but it is often more difficult and their options are more limited than domestic students. I don't want to sound too pessimistic about the US job opportunities for international graduates but want to be realistic. CICS Careers would be a good place to check for more information. They have a dashboard on their website that shows what companies hired international students over the past few years.",

And also a random student who hasn\u2019t completed their graduation yet, studying, with 3 out of 4 GPA with no research experience or no internship experience got in.

So if you apply as an out-of-state student, you generally remain in that status.  There is an appeal process for example if your parents/guardian relocated to MA and a job in-state paying state taxes.  There are also policies for persons on active duty with the armed forces or those who become independent of their parents/guardians.  The last can require taking time off from school, working and living in MA for a year or more, and then applying for re-admittance.

Royal Chicken & Kebab is a newcomer but has quickly become a favourite, their platters rock and so do their burgers & fried oreos, plus they're inexpensive as an added bonus. I dig Friendly's too but that's more of a local chain and part of it is nostalgia for me.\n\nHonourable mentions to Miss Florence Diner, Bub's BBQ, & Miss Saigon. Flo's is wonderful, just far away so it gets a bit pricey, so a once in a blue moon type of deal. Love their turkey clubs. Bub's is awesome too but even though they're closer the wait is usually long and it's also fairly pricey because it's BBQ. Miss Saigon is wonderful however they're not on doordash so you either have to go there or use Delivery Express, it's a local delivery service but their app is kinda janky.\n\nAnd finally a shout out to Pig Park BBQ in Ware. They don't deliver here because it's a bit of a hike but if you're hankering for BBQ they're worth trying, Bub's is great but they're even better as far as the meats go.\n\nEdit: oh! 110 Grill is great too, just pricey as far as portions go. I'd recommend eating in there, they have good drinks.",

The Pho Bo Sate is my absolute fav but the way they straddle Thai & Malaysian food is so amazing, every dish sings! Yeah I\u2019ve tried basically everything on the menu. The owner is from Malaysia & works her butt off! Great fruit, milk & boba tea. All the recipes are her family\u2019s & truly a family operation. I lived in Singapore & spent so much time in Malaysia, I was really bummed about moving home but this little spot just transports you. They\u2019re closed on Mondays. \nAnother great spot to check out uptown Amherst is MOMOs, I don\u2019t think they deliver either but their Lamb Momos (dumplings) will put a smile on your face for a straight 24hrs. If they still have their cold spicy noodles, a must try but they are spicy. They\u2019re closed on Tuesdays. \nI also second Lili\u2019s but no delivery.\nBueno is ALWAYS good & they\u2019re on DoorDash & a few other delivery services, same with Antonio\u2019s, the black sheep deli is on DoorDash too & while they\u2019re mostly lunch hours, they\u2019re wonderful & Formosa Chinese is nice authentic hunan style cuisine, also on DoorDash. Pita pockets is on DoorDash & so good, nicest family owned place, I always see the owner bringing unhoused ppl warm food for free. Also Fresh side is a must try! Some of the best pad Thai I\u2019ve ever had, everything there is great. Stay away from panda east; they used to be great but way past their prime, I picked up takeout the other day & the smell inside there is so rancid I couldn\u2019t even eat what I got.",

They \u201cwork\u201d but not very well. It take a a long time to do a not so big load, and they are still wet most of the time even after a 3 hour dry. This is because they don\u2019t have air vents for the dryer. So it\u2019s not really a dryer but it says it is. But I just went to the laundry parlor instead.\n\n2.) other house appliance are so so, shower head didn\u2019t have great pressure or consistency.

So they are not completely synonymous.  It is only recently that ResLife has used \"first year\" a lot as so many incoming freshman students were coming in with many AP or other transfer credits.  So the policy states \"freshmen\" and definitely for your first semester they will consider an incoming \"first year\" as matching that whether or not you already have 27 or more credits.  After that first semester things get a bit fuzzier, the policy actually states \"freshmen\" and that has specific definitions elsewhere in terms of credits.  So you might find yourself able to move off campus if you really want to and can convince the exemptions committee.\n\nResLife has also started referring to \"second years\" in some places for the same reasons.",

With so many achievers coming in with AP or dual enrollment credits as part of their high school transcripts they have modified that to incoming first year students.  That means some are eligible to move off campus in the Spring.\n\nOthers exempt are married, divorced or separated students, students with dependents, veterans, and students living with their parents within 40 miles of campus and commuting.",
