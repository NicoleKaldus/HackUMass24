I will be graduating with a Bachelor's in CS from NEU with a GPA of 3.8-3.9 in Spring 2025. I have no research experience but I have some leadership experience in a cs-related club. I also have done two co-ops and am in an internship right now. I will have strong LoRs from two of my managers. I am also of course an in-state applicant (I lived in MA even before attending NEU).\n\nWhat are my odds? I've seen some other reddit posts of some very impressive profiles getting rejected so it's a bit concerning. For undergrad I did consider it more of a target school (also applied for CS, was accepted) but I understand it's probably much more competitive for graduate school.",

I am the founder/president of the astronomy club at my school and did JV Volleyball for 2 years. I have an internship/tutor job with a special ed program where I tutor struggling students with math & physics. I also am heading into hospice volunteering very soon so that can be added on. My entire essay was about wanting to do astronomy but being told to do something more \u201csecure\u201d, and breaking through those expectations and continuing anyway. I had some stuff happen in freshman/sophomore year with my grandfather and grandmother both passing away very close in time, who were my main connections to being Puerto Rican and practically raised me, so it hit me hard, and affected my school work heavily (hence the low gpa).\n\nWould love to know if I have a chance of getting in or what I can do to improve it.

It was there in the 1980's when I was there and still there in 2013 when I took this picture but when I was out there in 2023 and early this year the painting has been missing and building management has no idea where it went.\n\n![img](i6bcdofamqzd1)\n\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So if you apply as an out-of-state student, you generally remain in that status.  There is an appeal process for example if your parents/guardian relocated to MA and a job in-state paying state taxes.  There are also policies for persons on active duty with the armed forces or those who become independent of their parents/guardians.  The last can require taking time off from school, working and living in MA for a year or more, and then applying for re-admittance.

You do have an advantage over non-WS students, the WS award subsidizes your pay at whichever department you get hired for.\n\nMost jobs pay minimum wage of $15 an hour, possibly a bit more if they have problems attracting applicants.  There are some that pay more but require some existing skills.  About the best paying student job is driving for the bus service, $21 an hour to start and they pay $16 an hour during training for a CDL.",

That's why birds like tree swallows and all varieties of fly-catchers, as an example, migrate because they eat primarily flying insects. But birds that are happy to eat seeds, berries, other plant matter or frozen bugs mainly stick around.\n\nThe Cardinal is notorious for eating berries that have frozen, thawed and frozen again such that the berries ferment. It's not unusual to see drunk Cardinals about in the winter.\n\nContrary to what a lot of people thing, American Robins don't typically migrate in the US. in winter. They simply change their food source and spend most of their time in the woods.\n\nAs for the Canada Goose, as long as they can find plant matter to eat they will stick around. Geese in Massachusetts are largely non-migratory though they might go to the Atlantic for a while if everything is snow covered and frozen.\n\nIf you don't see geese around the pond for a while this winter they are probably just over in Hadley picking over the farm land.\n\nSee migration map for the Canada Goose\n\n[https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Canada\\_Goose/overview](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Canada_Goose/overview)\n\nThere were far fewer Geese at Umass when I went there but there were a ton more mallard ducks and they largely stayed all winter. Here is a fun photo of all the ducks in winter from the 1985 UMass Amherst Yearbook\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ly4f85v4fizd1.jpeg?width=1612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f627136300ebfd9d8a70c458df024ad8330df198",

A small pocket was found in the Midwest and in an effort to save the largest goose in the world, conservationists brought the goose back to MA. The interesting thing is that the knowledge of a migratory path is passed down by parents teaching offspring and is not inate. So these geese have a strong urge to migrate with no idea where they were going. And to this day they take flight only to fly in circles and land in back in the campus pond or other nearby body of water. They will never migrate, but with abundant food and ever improving weather conditions for their species, they suffer little consequences.",

Sparked by allegations of sexual misconduct involving the Theta Chi fraternity and calls for greater university accountability, students took to social media, rallies, and forums to demand change. At a public forum, survivors shared how they felt mishandled by the university\u2019s reporting process, pointing to inadequate support and a pervasive sense of mistrust. Though UMass has responded with measures such as adopting the Survivor\u2019s Bill of Rights and establishing a Title IX Student Advisory Task Force, students are skeptical of the effectiveness of these initiatives. Greek life remains a flashpoint, with advocates arguing that the university\u2019s perceived leniency allows unsafe conditions to persist. A pending investigation by Comprehensive Investigations and Consulting, expected to yield recommendations, may bring additional changes, yet for many students, the university\u2019s response remains inadequate. SJC members and others assert that the administration prioritizes reputation and finances over student safety, while students continue to question how committed UMass is to implementing genuine reform.",

Of course I am willing to give school supplies for **free/cheaper price** if needed. Prices are based on what the current market price was that I looked up and based on what I paid for. Cash, BofA/Zelle, Cashapp, Venmo, Paypal. Note items like iclicker or certain electronics I will not hand them off till **END of semester,** but do not need to pay till you receive it . Any questions feel free to ask in comments or dm thank you!!\n\nIclicker 2 - New/Good Condition, $10\n\nDual Monitors WITH stand - Good/Fair condition  Dell 60hz 24in, this is an older model. Original price for each was $90. One of monitors has a black streak from bottom but doesn't go past half way in height, used it as a discord display, barely noticeable. Other monitor no streak. Asking for $65 for the better monitor but it wont have a stand with it because I do not have it with me (can look for it at home and hope my parents didn\u2019t throw it out), if want both it will have the stand $125. Negotiable. DM if want video/proof. This does NOT include hdmi, dp cables.\n\nHyperX QuadCast Mic : Good Condition Original price: $100, Asking for $85, Negotiable.\n\nTi-84 scientific calculator: Older model, no led screen good/fair condition. Gets the job done. Asking for $60, Negotiable\n\n**Going to put this out there since I\u2019m getting comments about my prices specifically about my monitors**.\u00a0\n\n1. If y\u2019all don\u2019t like the prices and the monitor isn\u2019t for you, that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t know why y\u2019all think I\u2019m shoving prices and saying no it\u2019s a set price. I even put the reason why I said it. So if I badly priced it you can simply just say hey lower this pls :)\u00a0\n2. \u00a0I even said multiple times, prices were negotiable.\u00a0\n3. Goal was to make side money if I could. If I don\u2019t sell that\u2019s fine.\u00a0Y\u2019all can kindly scroll if this post isn\u2019t for you.  Please don\u2019t get nasty at me. \n4. I literally have used electronics like the mic and calculator and I even searched it up on Amazon/target what they were still selling for. And knocked it down.

Of course I am willing to give school supplies for **free/cheaper price** if needed. Prices are based on what the current market price is.  Cash, BofA/Zelle, Cashapp, Venmo, Paypal. Note items like iclicker or certain electronics I will not hand them off till **END of semester,** but do not need to pay till you receive it . Any questions feel free to ask in comments or dm thank you!! \n\nIclicker 2 - New/Good Condition, $10\n\nOcean Spray Cranberry Juice (2x in stock) 1 for $3, 2 for $5\n\nCup Noodles (MICROWAVEABLE) Buldak Carbonara: $3 each, Shin Ramen $2 each, Tonkatsu Ramen: $3 each\n\nDual Monitors WITH stand - Good/Fair condition 60hz 24in, this is an older model.

Asking for $75 for the better monitor but it wont have a stand with it because I do not have it with me, if want both it will have the stand $140. Negotiable. DM if want video/proof. This does NOT include hdmi, dp cables. \n\nHyperX QuadCast Mic : Good Condition Original price: $100, Asking for $85, Negotiable. \n\nTi-84 scientific calculator: Older model, no led screen good/fair condition.

I know they housed international grad and undergrad students, plus some older students in Prince.  I do know that back then I just had to request permission to stay in my dorm room over Thanksgiving and Spring Break, and there was no extra charge.  Never looked into Winter Break while living on campus.  Started remaining in the area and living off campus after my second year as I could work for the bus service over January and Summer.",

But not something that happens often in recent years.  There is a big difference between a few percent of a 15-16k undergrad enrollment to the current level of nearly 10% of 23k+ being international.  Up until about 20 years ago there was legislation limiting the total non-MA enrollment to 15% or less.",

However you will be worked to the ground. \n\nAnd in today\u2019s job market Leetcode is what gives you a job. So juggling extremely hard classes, keeping a good GPA, with Leetcode is no easy task. \n\nOnly come here if you want to work like a dog and truly want to be the best. Source - someone who has had good internships with a high gpa. Most kids here are international so they aren\u2019t grinding Leetcode like that. Also CS here is crazy math heavy and you really gotta be good - unlike most schools where it\u2019s not nearly as hard. \n\nIf I just did school and didn\u2019t have to grind Leetcode I don\u2019t think I would struggle that much. But because like 80-90% of kids are international (do not be misled, this is the truth) they usually are just UCAs, internships in India, and do grad school. So for a domestic student you really gotta grind if you want good internships since you need to balance school with Leetcode",

So they are not completely synonymous.  It is only recently that ResLife has used \"first year\" a lot as so many incoming freshman students were coming in with many AP or other transfer credits.  So the policy states \"freshmen\" and definitely for your first semester they will consider an incoming \"first year\" as matching that whether or not you already have 27 or more credits.  After that first semester things get a bit fuzzier, the policy actually states \"freshmen\" and that has specific definitions elsewhere in terms of credits.  So you might find yourself able to move off campus if you really want to and can convince the exemptions committee.\n\nResLife has also started referring to \"second years\" in some places for the same reasons.",

With so many achievers coming in with AP or dual enrollment credits as part of their high school transcripts they have modified that to incoming first year students.  That means some are eligible to move off campus in the Spring.\n\nOthers exempt are married, divorced or separated students, students with dependents, veterans, and students living with their parents within 40 miles of campus and commuting.",

Quizzes are made by your TA, so it changes, but for everyone I have talked to so far (including myself) , the quizzes are pretty easy, and you can easily do well on them if you study. I have Jie Min at the moment and he is a phenomenal teacher. I heard Nikolaou is also pretty good. The course exams (so far) have no proofs and are purely application.

That will include items such as a copy of a lease showing you are not living with your parents full time.  They may also require a statement from your parents that they are not supporting you, and they will also verify you are not claimed as a dependent on taxes.  And they can still deny your change in status.\n\nEasiest way to do this is to leave school for a few years and come back at around age 25.  Then the assumption is you are independent of your parents.",

It's not that easy. I'm not sure if this is still the case, but I believe that the student had to be legally independent for two years, so you would need to take a two year break from college if you were trying that route. Not living with parents or not being claimed by them on tax forms does not make you an independent student for purposes of applying for federal student aid. https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/dependency",

So they don't sign up for it and find themselves in a bind.  So there may be enough rooms in the break dorms, but some of them are filled with students who don't need it.\n\nAdding to the issue is that the two cheap motels that also sometimes got used are closed.

I assume there's some open space there (but could be incorrect) and they could ensure the dining hall there stays open over break for this purpose. Maybe they'd need to organize a bigger shuttle to make this more feasible, but it's better than leaving students who aren't able to pay for or arrange break housing stuck.",

It wasn't that loud, and I thought it was just another Friday night, it's normal to see *several* cans of alcohol laying on the stairways and bathrooms, and puddles of booze or vomit aren't out of the ordinary. \n\nAt 1:52, a cop knocked on my door and I was scared as shit, I thought I did something. No, they just asked me about the glass smashing. Later my RD said it was after 10PM and not between 12-1 like I said (I actually forgot the exact time it happened), and asked why I didn't report it.\n\nIt's very easy to get desensitized to all the rowdiness in Southwest but you really should report anything suspicious.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Royal Chicken & Kebab is a newcomer but has quickly become a favourite, their platters rock and so do their burgers & fried oreos, plus they're inexpensive as an added bonus. I dig Friendly's too but that's more of a local chain and part of it is nostalgia for me.\n\nHonourable mentions to Miss Florence Diner, Bub's BBQ, & Miss Saigon. Flo's is wonderful, just far away so it gets a bit pricey, so a once in a blue moon type of deal. Love their turkey clubs. Bub's is awesome too but even though they're closer the wait is usually long and it's also fairly pricey because it's BBQ. Miss Saigon is wonderful however they're not on doordash so you either have to go there or use Delivery Express, it's a local delivery service but their app is kinda janky.\n\nAnd finally a shout out to Pig Park BBQ in Ware. They don't deliver here because it's a bit of a hike but if you're hankering for BBQ they're worth trying, Bub's is great but they're even better as far as the meats go.\n\nEdit: oh! 110 Grill is great too, just pricey as far as portions go. I'd recommend eating in there, they have good drinks.",

The Pho Bo Sate is my absolute fav but the way they straddle Thai & Malaysian food is so amazing, every dish sings! Yeah I\u2019ve tried basically everything on the menu. The owner is from Malaysia & works her butt off! Great fruit, milk & boba tea. All the recipes are her family\u2019s & truly a family operation. I lived in Singapore & spent so much time in Malaysia, I was really bummed about moving home but this little spot just transports you. They\u2019re closed on Mondays. \nAnother great spot to check out uptown Amherst is MOMOs, I don\u2019t think they deliver either but their Lamb Momos (dumplings) will put a smile on your face for a straight 24hrs. If they still have their cold spicy noodles, a must try but they are spicy. They\u2019re closed on Tuesdays. \nI also second Lili\u2019s but no delivery.\nBueno is ALWAYS good & they\u2019re on DoorDash & a few other delivery services, same with Antonio\u2019s, the black sheep deli is on DoorDash too & while they\u2019re mostly lunch hours, they\u2019re wonderful & Formosa Chinese is nice authentic hunan style cuisine, also on DoorDash. Pita pockets is on DoorDash & so good, nicest family owned place, I always see the owner bringing unhoused ppl warm food for free. Also Fresh side is a must try! Some of the best pad Thai I\u2019ve ever had, everything there is great. Stay away from panda east; they used to be great but way past their prime, I picked up takeout the other day & the smell inside there is so rancid I couldn\u2019t even eat what I got.",

The class averages on her exams are terrible for both current year and last year (and she hasn\u2019t reduced the complexity of her exams despite saying she would), and you get no review sessions and the teaching isn\u2019t the best. When people have questions, she\u2019d make promises of looking it up for next time but never does. The other physiology class with the other prof (idk his name but I know he\u2019s a guy I think), has exams wayy better, multiple choice retakes, review sessions (SI and TA), and better everything! Their curriculums are also different so it\u2019s not like you can just go to the other prof\u2019s SI session. So def take him if you have the option to!\n\nAs for Bio 311 (intro to genetics), I currently have Dr Amanda Raimer. She came from a different university and it\u2019s her first time texting her at UMass now, but it\u2019s pretty good. The way she has the stuff weighted gives you a chance for a pretty good grade due to reading check ins (one due before every class), problem sets (2 for each exam I think idk), and genetic connection assignments (only 3 in a semester). She also gives a lot of support which I really appreciate and she has this thing called Oops token which allows u have to 3 extensions for big assignments with no need for valid reasoning. I like her a lot, and some don\u2019t, but I\u2019d def recommend her!\n\nMy friend takes Bio 280 (intro to evolution), and she says it\u2019s like a free A if you take it with prof bruce. The teacher is super chill, you don\u2019t need to go to class, exams are online, etc! But there is a good amount of reading in this class!\n\nAnyways hope this helps :D",

I have no faith that UMass will consider my grievance, but if there are multiple grievances perhaps it would make a difference. This professor is sincerely punitive and unreasonable in her grading and its so fucking unfair UMass can just let her just ruin students' academic trajectories wantonly. \n\nhttps://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/756689\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The PhD program is supported through research and university funds being used to provide assistantships to PhD or MS/PhD track students.  MS CS degree candidates who do not have to do research or a masters thesis by policy normally do not get assistantships.  Their tuition is being used to support and fund the MS program.  They can apply for jobs as graders after their first semester, otherwise they are able to work regular student jobs and apply for applicable financial aid to partly pay for the program.",

I do know that some of the other schools and colleges at UMass do offer a masters degree w/ thesis track and provide some funding to those grad students.\n\nGlancing at the MS CS description it looks like CICS does not specifically have a thesis requirement for their MS CS.  But they do offer options for independent study research or a Masters Project done with one or two professors as either a paper or research.  Possibly contacting the program or others may get you more information on that.  But I personally don't know any recent grads from the CICS programs, the ones I knew were ages ago in the late '80s and early '90s.  The program has changed quite a bit since then.\n\nThe MS/PhD track does mention students getting involved in research from the beginning.

International graduates can use something called OPT to legally get a job in the US after graduating from undergrad or graduate academic programs in the US but, after the OPT period expires, a company will need to pay to sponsor a visa for a non-US citizen employee. The process for obtaining that visa can take a long time and is not guaranteed (there are limits to the numbers granted by the US government) and so many companies do not consider non-citizens for their positions.\nThere are plenty of international graduates who do get jobs in the US after completing the MS on CS, but it is often more difficult and their options are more limited than domestic students. I don't want to sound too pessimistic about the US job opportunities for international graduates but want to be realistic. CICS Careers would be a good place to check for more information. They have a dashboard on their website that shows what companies hired international students over the past few years.",
