I will be graduating with a Bachelor's in CS from NEU with a GPA of 3.8-3.9 in Spring 2025. I have no research experience but I have some leadership experience in a cs-related club. I also have done two co-ops and am in an internship right now. I will have strong LoRs from two of my managers. I am also of course an in-state applicant (I lived in MA even before attending NEU).\n\nWhat are my odds? I've seen some other reddit posts of some very impressive profiles getting rejected so it's a bit concerning. For undergrad I did consider it more of a target school (also applied for CS, was accepted) but I understand it's probably much more competitive for graduate school.",

I am the founder/president of the astronomy club at my school and did JV Volleyball for 2 years. I have an internship/tutor job with a special ed program where I tutor struggling students with math & physics. I also am heading into hospice volunteering very soon so that can be added on. My entire essay was about wanting to do astronomy but being told to do something more \u201csecure\u201d, and breaking through those expectations and continuing anyway. I had some stuff happen in freshman/sophomore year with my grandfather and grandmother both passing away very close in time, who were my main connections to being Puerto Rican and practically raised me, so it hit me hard, and affected my school work heavily (hence the low gpa).\n\nWould love to know if I have a chance of getting in or what I can do to improve it.

The certificate was 5 classes (as opposed to most minors, which require at least 6). In my experience, all of the classes were exceedingly easy. As far as double majors go, I think journalism is very doable, though granted I didn't take any of the upper level courses. What I really regret is not writing more for the *Daily Collegian* or local magazines. There's so many opportunities the department can hook you up with that I didn't take advantage of. I think getting your work published is what really matters on resumes. \n\nMy career today isn't related to journalism (I'm in education), but I think these classes actually really improved my ability to communicate complex ideas to the general public. I also learned how to ask people the right questions to get their perspective, which in general is quite valuable for just understanding where other human beings are coming from. No regrets with choosing this path, but it is annoying to have to explain to everyone the distinction between a certificate and a minor. Hope this helps!",

They have weekly meetings for the different sections, including news, sports, culture, and opinion. At the news meetings, they go over weekly events on campus that they would like covered, or you can submit your own. When I was there at least, there were always way more events to cover than there were student reporters to write about them (everything from guest speakers to art presentations to student organization activities), so plenty of opportunities for those who seek them out. I wrote a few news articles and opinion pieces, but never got as involved with the paper as I could have.\n\nMy first semester (2017), the *Daily Collegian* was actually printed daily and placed in all of the dorms each morning. Over the next few semesters they cut it to I think three times a week and then once a week. I have no idea what the printing schedule is like post-COVID. To be honest, the articles are not widely read by the student body unless covering a significant campus event, like crime alerts or controversial guest speakers. That being said, as I'm sure you already know, student press is extremely important for informing people about these events and for recording UMass's history. Scroll through this subreddit a bit and you'll see plenty of links to *Collegian* articles. It's the best source of information about the real student experience at UMass. \n\nI never submitted to a magazine, but they are much more selective. One of them that a lot of journalism majors submitted to was the *UMass Magazine,* but there were others in the area unaffiliated with the university whose names I can't remember.",

Basically about a month ago (mentioned in this subreddit by \nu/gyukatsuu), a male was caught peeking through the shower stalls in a women\u2019s bathroom and trying to take pics in orchard hill.\n\nTo be honest I never knew this was a thing at Umass. For my past few years dorming, I have never seen a male in the female bathroom and I\u2019ve never used the male bathroom. Maybe it\u2019s because the halls I\u2019ve lived in weren\u2019t in Southwest, where everyone else is saying it\u2019s common.

OTOH if one considers the level of discomfort and anxiety, I suspect that women are more uncomfortable and anxious with men in their bathroom than men are uncomfortable or anxious with women in their bathroom. So when it comes to trying to make people not feel uncomfortable or anxious, is it really a double standard to focus on the largest cause of that anxiety which is likely men using women's bathrooms.\n\nBesides, as mentioned, the overwhelming volume of reported sexual assaults are men against women. Women have good reason to be anxious about men in their bathrooms.\n\nWhen I was a freshman we had Co-Ed bathrooms. That was changed in my sophomore year. As a guy I wasn't uncomfortable with women in the bathroom but I was in OHill where women used the back stalls and men used the front stalls. That worked out but if someone used the wrong stalls it did create issues. And as I understand it OHill bathrooms may be unique among the residence halls that it was fairly easy to designate one side for men and the other side for women.",

That's why birds like tree swallows and all varieties of fly-catchers, as an example, migrate because they eat primarily flying insects. But birds that are happy to eat seeds, berries, other plant matter or frozen bugs mainly stick around.\n\nThe Cardinal is notorious for eating berries that have frozen, thawed and frozen again such that the berries ferment. It's not unusual to see drunk Cardinals about in the winter.\n\nContrary to what a lot of people thing, American Robins don't typically migrate in the US. in winter. They simply change their food source and spend most of their time in the woods.\n\nAs for the Canada Goose, as long as they can find plant matter to eat they will stick around. Geese in Massachusetts are largely non-migratory though they might go to the Atlantic for a while if everything is snow covered and frozen.\n\nIf you don't see geese around the pond for a while this winter they are probably just over in Hadley picking over the farm land.\n\nSee migration map for the Canada Goose\n\n[https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Canada\\_Goose/overview](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Canada_Goose/overview)\n\nThere were far fewer Geese at Umass when I went there but there were a ton more mallard ducks and they largely stayed all winter.

A small pocket was found in the Midwest and in an effort to save the largest goose in the world, conservationists brought the goose back to MA. The interesting thing is that the knowledge of a migratory path is passed down by parents teaching offspring and is not inate. So these geese have a strong urge to migrate with no idea where they were going. And to this day they take flight only to fly in circles and land in back in the campus pond or other nearby body of water. They will never migrate, but with abundant food and ever improving weather conditions for their species, they suffer little consequences.",

Sparked by allegations of sexual misconduct involving the Theta Chi fraternity and calls for greater university accountability, students took to social media, rallies, and forums to demand change. At a public forum, survivors shared how they felt mishandled by the university\u2019s reporting process, pointing to inadequate support and a pervasive sense of mistrust. Though UMass has responded with measures such as adopting the Survivor\u2019s Bill of Rights and establishing a Title IX Student Advisory Task Force, students are skeptical of the effectiveness of these initiatives. Greek life remains a flashpoint, with advocates arguing that the university\u2019s perceived leniency allows unsafe conditions to persist. A pending investigation by Comprehensive Investigations and Consulting, expected to yield recommendations, may bring additional changes, yet for many students, the university\u2019s response remains inadequate. SJC members and others assert that the administration prioritizes reputation and finances over student safety, while students continue to question how committed UMass is to implementing genuine reform.",

However, students are eligible for on-campus job at UMass\n* SUNY Buffalo's program is 1.5 years, while UMass is a regular 2-year master's\n* UMass offers a terminal MS program, whereas SUNY Buffalo has a research-based track (which I got an admit to) \n\nI'd like to hear your opinions on these two programs. Do you think UMass Amherst's program justifies the extra cost? How significant is the difference between a terminal MS and a research-based MS for future career prospects? I'm trying to justify the extra cost UMass's program. Any insights are welcome, particularly from students/alumni at these programs!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Of course I am willing to give school supplies for **free/cheaper price** if needed. Prices are based on what the current market price is.  Cash, BofA/Zelle, Cashapp, Venmo, Paypal. Note items like iclicker or certain electronics I will not hand them off till **END of semester,** but do not need to pay till you receive it . Any questions feel free to ask in comments or dm thank you!! \n\nIclicker 2 - New/Good Condition, $10\n\nOcean Spray Cranberry Juice (2x in stock) 1 for $3, 2 for $5\n\nCup Noodles (MICROWAVEABLE) Buldak Carbonara: $3 each, Shin Ramen $2 each, Tonkatsu Ramen: $3 each\n\nDual Monitors WITH stand - Good/Fair condition 60hz 24in, this is an older model. Original price for each was $90. One of monitors has a black streak from bottom but doesn't go past half way in height, used it as a discord display, barely noticeable. Other monitor no streak. Asking for $75 for the better monitor but it wont have a stand with it because I do not have it with me, if want both it will have the stand $140. Negotiable. DM if want video/proof. This does NOT include hdmi, dp cables. \n\nHyperX QuadCast Mic : Good Condition Original price: $100, Asking for $85, Negotiable. \n\nTi-84 scientific calculator: Older model, no led screen good/fair condition.

The 10 page paper sounds daunting but you basically get to write about any North American comic and the history behind it, very easy and fun class, make sure to get the discussion section with the professor (usually on a Wednesday)",

They \u201cwork\u201d but not very well. It take a a long time to do a not so big load, and they are still wet most of the time even after a 3 hour dry. This is because they don\u2019t have air vents for the dryer. So it\u2019s not really a dryer but it says it is. But I just went to the laundry parlor instead.\n\n2.) other house appliance are so so, shower head didn\u2019t have great pressure or consistency. Dishwasher wasn\u2019t always great but I could fix that myself. Mostly little stuff. \n\nUnlike the previous comments I never had a pest issue but I also lived in the 4th floor both years.

And them making us fight with our lives in 240 and 230 while also doing Leetcode is brutal. \n\nYou will leave here a genius. And you will know a lot more than in my opinion 99% of CS kids. However you will be worked to the ground. \n\nAnd in today\u2019s job market Leetcode is what gives you a job. So juggling extremely hard classes, keeping a good GPA, with Leetcode is no easy task. \n\nOnly come here if you want to work like a dog and truly want to be the best. Source - someone who has had good internships with a high gpa. Most kids here are international so they aren\u2019t grinding Leetcode like that. Also CS here is crazy math heavy and you really gotta be good - unlike most schools where it\u2019s not nearly as hard. \n\nIf I just did school and didn\u2019t have to grind Leetcode I don\u2019t think I would struggle that much. But because like 80-90% of kids are international (do not be misled, this is the truth) they usually are just UCAs, internships in India, and do grad school. So for a domestic student you really gotta grind if you want good internships since you need to balance school with Leetcode",

So they are not completely synonymous.  It is only recently that ResLife has used \"first year\" a lot as so many incoming freshman students were coming in with many AP or other transfer credits.  So the policy states \"freshmen\" and definitely for your first semester they will consider an incoming \"first year\" as matching that whether or not you already have 27 or more credits.  After that first semester things get a bit fuzzier, the policy actually states \"freshmen\" and that has specific definitions elsewhere in terms of credits.  So you might find yourself able to move off campus if you really want to and can convince the exemptions committee.\n\nResLife has also started referring to \"second years\" in some places for the same reasons.",

(These are standardized for all Calc 3 classes). 12 percent is homework .  8 percent is quizzes. Quizzes are made by your TA, so it changes, but for everyone I have talked to so far (including myself) , the quizzes are pretty easy, and you can easily do well on them if you study. I have Jie Min at the moment and he is a phenomenal teacher. I heard Nikolaou is also pretty good. The course exams (so far) have no proofs and are purely application. Everything in class and discussions is solo. (no colab). Lmk if you have any specific questions. Hope this helped.",

It's not that easy. I'm not sure if this is still the case, but I believe that the student had to be legally independent for two years, so you would need to take a two year break from college if you were trying that route. Not living with parents or not being claimed by them on tax forms does not make you an independent student for purposes of applying for federal student aid. https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/dependency",

So they don't sign up for it and find themselves in a bind.  So there may be enough rooms in the break dorms, but some of them are filled with students who don't need it.\n\nAdding to the issue is that the two cheap motels that also sometimes got used are closed.  Econolodge in Hadley is being converted to low income housing, University Lodge just south of campus on N Pleasant St is being renovated and the owner wants to turn it into student apartments.",

I assume there's some open space there (but could be incorrect) and they could ensure the dining hall there stays open over break for this purpose. Maybe they'd need to organize a bigger shuttle to make this more feasible, but it's better than leaving students who aren't able to pay for or arrange break housing stuck.",

Older campus maps mark buildings that have them (I have a Google Drive folder with maps from the turn of the century to modern day if you're interested). The most obvious former fallout shelter is several floors down in the Cold Storage building, most easily accessed from the attached Chenoweth Laboratory building.",

Royal Chicken & Kebab is a newcomer but has quickly become a favourite, their platters rock and so do their burgers & fried oreos, plus they're inexpensive as an added bonus. I dig Friendly's too but that's more of a local chain and part of it is nostalgia for me.\n\nHonourable mentions to Miss Florence Diner, Bub's BBQ, & Miss Saigon. Flo's is wonderful, just far away so it gets a bit pricey, so a once in a blue moon type of deal. Love their turkey clubs. Bub's is awesome too but even though they're closer the wait is usually long and it's also fairly pricey because it's BBQ. Miss Saigon is wonderful however they're not on doordash so you either have to go there or use Delivery Express, it's a local delivery service but their app is kinda janky.\n\nAnd finally a shout out to Pig Park BBQ in Ware. They don't deliver here because it's a bit of a hike but if you're hankering for BBQ they're worth trying, Bub's is great but they're even better as far as the meats go.\n\nEdit: oh! 110 Grill is great too, just pricey as far as portions go. I'd recommend eating in there, they have good drinks.",

The Pho Bo Sate is my absolute fav but the way they straddle Thai & Malaysian food is so amazing, every dish sings! Yeah I\u2019ve tried basically everything on the menu. The owner is from Malaysia & works her butt off! Great fruit, milk & boba tea. All the recipes are her family\u2019s & truly a family operation. I lived in Singapore & spent so much time in Malaysia, I was really bummed about moving home but this little spot just transports you. They\u2019re closed on Mondays. \nAnother great spot to check out uptown Amherst is MOMOs, I don\u2019t think they deliver either but their Lamb Momos (dumplings) will put a smile on your face for a straight 24hrs. If they still have their cold spicy noodles, a must try but they are spicy. They\u2019re closed on Tuesdays. \nI also second Lili\u2019s but no delivery.\nBueno is ALWAYS good & they\u2019re on DoorDash & a few other delivery services, same with Antonio\u2019s, the black sheep deli is on DoorDash too & while they\u2019re mostly lunch hours, they\u2019re wonderful & Formosa Chinese is nice authentic hunan style cuisine, also on DoorDash. Pita pockets is on DoorDash & so good, nicest family owned place, I always see the owner bringing unhoused ppl warm food for free. Also Fresh side is a must try! Some of the best pad Thai I\u2019ve ever had, everything there is great. Stay away from panda east; they used to be great but way past their prime, I picked up takeout the other day & the smell inside there is so rancid I couldn\u2019t even eat what I got.",

The class averages on her exams are terrible for both current year and last year (and she hasn\u2019t reduced the complexity of her exams despite saying she would), and you get no review sessions and the teaching isn\u2019t the best. When people have questions, she\u2019d make promises of looking it up for next time but never does. The other physiology class with the other prof (idk his name but I know he\u2019s a guy I think), has exams wayy better, multiple choice retakes, review sessions (SI and TA), and better everything! Their curriculums are also different so it\u2019s not like you can just go to the other prof\u2019s SI session. So def take him if you have the option to!\n\nAs for Bio 311 (intro to genetics), I currently have Dr Amanda Raimer. She came from a different university and it\u2019s her first time texting her at UMass now, but it\u2019s pretty good. The way she has the stuff weighted gives you a chance for a pretty good grade due to reading check ins (one due before every class), problem sets (2 for each exam I think idk), and genetic connection assignments (only 3 in a semester). She also gives a lot of support which I really appreciate and she has this thing called Oops token which allows u have to 3 extensions for big assignments with no need for valid reasoning. I like her a lot, and some don\u2019t, but I\u2019d def recommend her!\n\nMy friend takes Bio 280 (intro to evolution), and she says it\u2019s like a free A if you take it with prof bruce. The teacher is super chill, you don\u2019t need to go to class, exams are online, etc! But there is a good amount of reading in this class!\n\nAnyways hope this helps :D",
