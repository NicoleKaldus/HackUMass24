The certificate was 5 classes (as opposed to most minors, which require at least 6). In my experience, all of the classes were exceedingly easy. As far as double majors go, I think journalism is very doable, though granted I didn't take any of the upper level courses. What I really regret is not writing more for the *Daily Collegian* or local magazines. There's so many opportunities the department can hook you up with that I didn't take advantage of. I think getting your work published is what really matters on resumes. \n\nMy career today isn't related to journalism (I'm in education), but I think these classes actually really improved my ability to communicate complex ideas to the general public. I also learned how to ask people the right questions to get their perspective, which in general is quite valuable for just understanding where other human beings are coming from. No regrets with choosing this path, but it is annoying to have to explain to everyone the distinction between a certificate and a minor. Hope this helps!",

They have weekly meetings for the different sections, including news, sports, culture, and opinion. At the news meetings, they go over weekly events on campus that they would like covered, or you can submit your own. When I was there at least, there were always way more events to cover than there were student reporters to write about them (everything from guest speakers to art presentations to student organization activities), so plenty of opportunities for those who seek them out. I wrote a few news articles and opinion pieces, but never got as involved with the paper as I could have.\n\nMy first semester (2017), the *Daily Collegian* was actually printed daily and placed in all of the dorms each morning. Over the next few semesters they cut it to I think three times a week and then once a week. I have no idea what the printing schedule is like post-COVID. To be honest, the articles are not widely read by the student body unless covering a significant campus event, like crime alerts or controversial guest speakers. That being said, as I'm sure you already know, student press is extremely important for informing people about these events and for recording UMass's history. Scroll through this subreddit a bit and you'll see plenty of links to *Collegian* articles. It's the best source of information about the real student experience at UMass. \n\nI never submitted to a magazine, but they are much more selective. One of them that a lot of journalism majors submitted to was the *UMass Magazine,* but there were others in the area unaffiliated with the university whose names I can't remember.",

Sadly, statistically women are more likely to be sexually assaulted by men than the vice versa so there is stigmatism around that. Also this semester, a situation in the women\u2019s bathroom happened involving a male so some girls might be on edge because of that. Basically about a month ago (mentioned in this subreddit by \nu/gyukatsuu), a male was caught peeking through the shower stalls in a women\u2019s bathroom and trying to take pics in orchard hill.\n\nTo be honest I never knew this was a thing at Umass. For my past few years dorming, I have never seen a male in the female bathroom and I\u2019ve never used the male bathroom. Maybe it\u2019s because the halls I\u2019ve lived in weren\u2019t in Southwest, where everyone else is saying it\u2019s common. I personally would never feel comfortable doing that and to be safe I would def not recommend doing that considering what people in the subreddit are going through.",

OTOH if one considers the level of discomfort and anxiety, I suspect that women are more uncomfortable and anxious with men in their bathroom than men are uncomfortable or anxious with women in their bathroom. So when it comes to trying to make people not feel uncomfortable or anxious, is it really a double standard to focus on the largest cause of that anxiety which is likely men using women's bathrooms.\n\nBesides, as mentioned, the overwhelming volume of reported sexual assaults are men against women. Women have good reason to be anxious about men in their bathrooms.\n\nWhen I was a freshman we had Co-Ed bathrooms. That was changed in my sophomore year. As a guy I wasn't uncomfortable with women in the bathroom but I was in OHill where women used the back stalls and men used the front stalls. That worked out but if someone used the wrong stalls it did create issues. And as I understand it OHill bathrooms may be unique among the residence halls that it was fairly easy to designate one side for men and the other side for women.",

She lives in a 4bd 2 bath unit. \n\nThe rest of her roommates are females so they prefer a new female roommate \n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, Olympia is one of the best off campus stops as it is renovated, fully furnished, close to campus, easy access to bus, and student only apartment. \n\nMessage if interested and I can connect you to her about prices. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That's why birds like tree swallows and all varieties of fly-catchers, as an example, migrate because they eat primarily flying insects. But birds that are happy to eat seeds, berries, other plant matter or frozen bugs mainly stick around.\n\nThe Cardinal is notorious for eating berries that have frozen, thawed and frozen again such that the berries ferment. It's not unusual to see drunk Cardinals about in the winter.\n\nContrary to what a lot of people thing, American Robins don't typically migrate in the US. in winter. They simply change their food source and spend most of their time in the woods.\n\nAs for the Canada Goose, as long as they can find plant matter to eat they will stick around. Geese in Massachusetts are largely non-migratory though they might go to the Atlantic for a while if everything is snow covered and frozen.\n\nIf you don't see geese around the pond for a while this winter they are probably just over in Hadley picking over the farm land.\n\nSee migration map for the Canada Goose\n\n[https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Canada\\_Goose/overview](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Canada_Goose/overview)\n\nThere were far fewer Geese at Umass when I went there but there were a ton more mallard ducks and they largely stayed all winter.

A small pocket was found in the Midwest and in an effort to save the largest goose in the world, conservationists brought the goose back to MA. The interesting thing is that the knowledge of a migratory path is passed down by parents teaching offspring and is not inate. So these geese have a strong urge to migrate with no idea where they were going. And to this day they take flight only to fly in circles and land in back in the campus pond or other nearby body of water. They will never migrate, but with abundant food and ever improving weather conditions for their species, they suffer little consequences.",

Sparked by allegations of sexual misconduct involving the Theta Chi fraternity and calls for greater university accountability, students took to social media, rallies, and forums to demand change. At a public forum, survivors shared how they felt mishandled by the university\u2019s reporting process, pointing to inadequate support and a pervasive sense of mistrust. Though UMass has responded with measures such as adopting the Survivor\u2019s Bill of Rights and establishing a Title IX Student Advisory Task Force, students are skeptical of the effectiveness of these initiatives. Greek life remains a flashpoint, with advocates arguing that the university\u2019s perceived leniency allows unsafe conditions to persist. A pending investigation by Comprehensive Investigations and Consulting, expected to yield recommendations, may bring additional changes, yet for many students, the university\u2019s response remains inadequate. SJC members and others assert that the administration prioritizes reputation and finances over student safety, while students continue to question how committed UMass is to implementing genuine reform.",

Failing that find your dorms single occupant bathroom (idk if all dorms have them but if they do it\u2019s probably on the first floor) other buildings on campus will if your in a pinch. Also heads up insertion can hurt if the cup is dry. Apart from the mess this is why the shower is good.Easiest way I\u2019ve found to sanitize them is a cup designated for this purpose (this should be done every month). Then either microwave the cup to boiling or use a kettle. After let it sit for about 8-10 minutes and it should be sanitized. Bonus this strategy is discreet if you\u2019re self conscious . It will not require you to leave your dorm room except to dispose of water. If your looking for recommendations flex cup is easy to use and beginner friendly. Also if it hurts at first try diferentes positions or positions there\u2019s a strong chance that\u2019s the issue. (There are loads of helpful videos on how to put one and and pros and cons of different cups). I personally really like cups I find I cramp less and have almost no bleed issues.",

However you will be worked to the ground. \n\nAnd in today\u2019s job market Leetcode is what gives you a job. So juggling extremely hard classes, keeping a good GPA, with Leetcode is no easy task. \n\nOnly come here if you want to work like a dog and truly want to be the best. Source - someone who has had good internships with a high gpa. Most kids here are international so they aren\u2019t grinding Leetcode like that. Also CS here is crazy math heavy and you really gotta be good - unlike most schools where it\u2019s not nearly as hard. \n\nIf I just did school and didn\u2019t have to grind Leetcode I don\u2019t think I would struggle that much. But because like 80-90% of kids are international (do not be misled, this is the truth) they usually are just UCAs, internships in India, and do grad school. So for a domestic student you really gotta grind if you want good internships since you need to balance school with Leetcode",

I truly believe the students here are best of the best. I went to a top high school in MA, lots of AP classes - with top AP scores, and top grades and UMass CS is truly a different level of hard. \n\nI believe Umass CS deserves more recognition.

They \u201cwork\u201d but not very well. It take a a long time to do a not so big load, and they are still wet most of the time even after a 3 hour dry. This is because they don\u2019t have air vents for the dryer. So it\u2019s not really a dryer but it says it is. But I just went to the laundry parlor instead.\n\n2.) other house appliance are so so, shower head didn\u2019t have great pressure or consistency. Dishwasher wasn\u2019t always great but I could fix that myself. Mostly little stuff. \n\nUnlike the previous comments I never had a pest issue but I also lived in the 4th floor both years.

So they are not completely synonymous.  It is only recently that ResLife has used \"first year\" a lot as so many incoming freshman students were coming in with many AP or other transfer credits.  So the policy states \"freshmen\" and definitely for your first semester they will consider an incoming \"first year\" as matching that whether or not you already have 27 or more credits.  After that first semester things get a bit fuzzier, the policy actually states \"freshmen\" and that has specific definitions elsewhere in terms of credits.  So you might find yourself able to move off campus if you really want to and can convince the exemptions committee.\n\nResLife has also started referring to \"second years\" in some places for the same reasons.",

Quizzes are made by your TA, so it changes, but for everyone I have talked to so far (including myself) , the quizzes are pretty easy, and you can easily do well on them if you study. I have Jie Min at the moment and he is a phenomenal teacher. I heard Nikolaou is also pretty good. The course exams (so far) have no proofs and are purely application. Everything in class and discussions is solo. (no colab). Lmk if you have any specific questions. Hope this helped.",

So they don't sign up for it and find themselves in a bind.  So there may be enough rooms in the break dorms, but some of them are filled with students who don't need it.\n\nAdding to the issue is that the two cheap motels that also sometimes got used are closed.

I assume there's some open space there (but could be incorrect) and they could ensure the dining hall there stays open over break for this purpose. Maybe they'd need to organize a bigger shuttle to make this more feasible, but it's better than leaving students who aren't able to pay for or arrange break housing stuck.",

That will include items such as a copy of a lease showing you are not living with your parents full time.  They may also require a statement from your parents that they are not supporting you, and they will also verify you are not claimed as a dependent on taxes.  And they can still deny your change in status.\n\nEasiest way to do this is to leave school for a few years and come back at around age 25.

It's not that easy. I'm not sure if this is still the case, but I believe that the student had to be legally independent for two years, so you would need to take a two year break from college if you were trying that route. Not living with parents or not being claimed by them on tax forms does not make you an independent student for purposes of applying for federal student aid. https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/dependency",

Older campus maps mark buildings that have them (I have a Google Drive folder with maps from the turn of the century to modern day if you're interested). The most obvious former fallout shelter is several floors down in the Cold Storage building, most easily accessed from the attached Chenoweth Laboratory building.",

The class averages on her exams are terrible for both current year and last year (and she hasn\u2019t reduced the complexity of her exams despite saying she would), and you get no review sessions and the teaching isn\u2019t the best. When people have questions, she\u2019d make promises of looking it up for next time but never does. The other physiology class with the other prof (idk his name but I know he\u2019s a guy I think), has exams wayy better, multiple choice retakes, review sessions (SI and TA), and better everything! Their curriculums are also different so it\u2019s not like you can just go to the other prof\u2019s SI session. So def take him if you have the option to!\n\nAs for Bio 311 (intro to genetics), I currently have Dr Amanda Raimer. She came from a different university and it\u2019s her first time texting her at UMass now, but it\u2019s pretty good. The way she has the stuff weighted gives you a chance for a pretty good grade due to reading check ins (one due before every class), problem sets (2 for each exam I think idk), and genetic connection assignments (only 3 in a semester). She also gives a lot of support which I really appreciate and she has this thing called Oops token which allows u have to 3 extensions for big assignments with no need for valid reasoning. I like her a lot, and some don\u2019t, but I\u2019d def recommend her!\n\nMy friend takes Bio 280 (intro to evolution), and she says it\u2019s like a free A if you take it with prof bruce. The teacher is super chill, you don\u2019t need to go to class, exams are online, etc! But there is a good amount of reading in this class!\n\nAnyways hope this helps :D",

Royal Chicken & Kebab is a newcomer but has quickly become a favourite, their platters rock and so do their burgers & fried oreos, plus they're inexpensive as an added bonus. I dig Friendly's too but that's more of a local chain and part of it is nostalgia for me.\n\nHonourable mentions to Miss Florence Diner, Bub's BBQ, & Miss Saigon. Flo's is wonderful, just far away so it gets a bit pricey, so a once in a blue moon type of deal. Love their turkey clubs. Bub's is awesome too but even though they're closer the wait is usually long and it's also fairly pricey because it's BBQ. Miss Saigon is wonderful however they're not on doordash so you either have to go there or use Delivery Express, it's a local delivery service but their app is kinda janky.\n\nAnd finally a shout out to Pig Park BBQ in Ware. They don't deliver here because it's a bit of a hike but if you're hankering for BBQ they're worth trying, Bub's is great but they're even better as far as the meats go.\n\nEdit: oh! 110 Grill is great too, just pricey as far as portions go. I'd recommend eating in there, they have good drinks.",

The Pho Bo Sate is my absolute fav but the way they straddle Thai & Malaysian food is so amazing, every dish sings! Yeah I\u2019ve tried basically everything on the menu. The owner is from Malaysia & works her butt off! Great fruit, milk & boba tea. All the recipes are her family\u2019s & truly a family operation. I lived in Singapore & spent so much time in Malaysia, I was really bummed about moving home but this little spot just transports you. They\u2019re closed on Mondays. \nAnother great spot to check out uptown Amherst is MOMOs, I don\u2019t think they deliver either but their Lamb Momos (dumplings) will put a smile on your face for a straight 24hrs. If they still have their cold spicy noodles, a must try but they are spicy. They\u2019re closed on Tuesdays. \nI also second Lili\u2019s but no delivery.\nBueno is ALWAYS good & they\u2019re on DoorDash & a few other delivery services, same with Antonio\u2019s, the black sheep deli is on DoorDash too & while they\u2019re mostly lunch hours, they\u2019re wonderful & Formosa Chinese is nice authentic hunan style cuisine, also on DoorDash. Pita pockets is on DoorDash & so good, nicest family owned place, I always see the owner bringing unhoused ppl warm food for free. Also Fresh side is a must try! Some of the best pad Thai I\u2019ve ever had, everything there is great. Stay away from panda east; they used to be great but way past their prime, I picked up takeout the other day & the smell inside there is so rancid I couldn\u2019t even eat what I got.",

Is it possible to join a soccer club just for fun, or are most teams super competitive? I\u2019m not looking to play only in the first team or not at all\u2014are there any more casual teams or \u201cB\u201d teams?\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve noticed that most shared housing listings seem to be for girls only, and as a guy, it\u2019s been tough to find something. Is it typical for Shared flats in the U.S. to be separated by gender? Would love any tips or advice on this.\n\nThanks in advance, looking forward to experiencing UMass!\n",

                "text": "There are several levels of soccer play on campus.  At the club level it is somewhat competitive as club sports compete in intercollegiate games against other colleges and universities in the region.  This is a step down from intercollegiate games at the varsity level.\n\nThen there are intramural leagues at the recreational level.  Those have various levels of competition.  Some are co-rec.  But from past knowledge of the schedule from a co-worker who refereed on the side, soccer league play is just in the Fall.  That may have changed.  There still are chances for pickup games.\n\nIf you are an undergraduate they do offer on-campus housing to exchange students.  Same policy and applications as for transfer students.\n\nMy experience is that most of the mixed gender apartments are occupied by friend groups or couples.  So if an opening comes up from someone leaving they tend to look among friends and close acquaintances they already know.  So what you have been seeing may be just those who kept to filling their apartments with a single gender.\n\nYou may see more sublets posted by people as their plans for the Spring firm up closer to the end of the Fall semester.  That is when people know they are definitely leaving due to graduation, internships, semesters abroad, and so on.",

Just the Fall schedule is currently posted.\n\nWish I could tell you more about soccer, but I didn't do sports when I was student.  My son participated in a different club sport when he was a student at UMass that had tournaments both in the Fall and Spring.\n\nMore persons should be posting looking to sublet their space in apartments and rented houses as it gets closer to the end of the Fall semester.  I don't know which places you have already looked at, but many post on the Off Campus Housing site - https://offcampushousing.umass.edu/.  I have also heard of 2 or 3 Facebook pages, but also have seen warnings to watch out for scams among the legitimate postings.  Also check with the department you are doing the exchange with, they may know of some grad student looking for roommates.",

I\u2019d really appreciate some honest feedback from current students or alumni who have been through it. Is this true? How was your experience? Did you find the program valuable and worthwhile?

So not \"just anyone\" was accepted.  241 of those enrolled in CICS.  Average GREs from those who reported scores were 166 Math, 156 Verbal.\n\nThe \"primarily exists to support the PhD program financially\" is a mischaracterization of the situation.  The PhD program is supported through research and university funds being used to provide assistantships to PhD or MS/PhD track students.  MS CS degree candidates who do not have to do research or a masters thesis by policy normally do not get assistantships.  Their tuition is being used to support and fund the MS program.  They can apply for jobs as graders after their first semester, otherwise they are able to work regular student jobs and apply for applicable financial aid to partly pay for the program.",

But they do offer options for independent study research or a Masters Project done with one or two professors as either a paper or research.  Possibly contacting the program or others may get you more information on that.  But I personally don't know any recent grads from the CICS programs, the ones I knew were ages ago in the late '80s and early '90s.

International graduates can use something called OPT to legally get a job in the US after graduating from undergrad or graduate academic programs in the US but, after the OPT period expires, a company will need to pay to sponsor a visa for a non-US citizen employee. The process for obtaining that visa can take a long time and is not guaranteed (there are limits to the numbers granted by the US government) and so many companies do not consider non-citizens for their positions.\nThere are plenty of international graduates who do get jobs in the US after completing the MS on CS, but it is often more difficult and their options are more limited than domestic students. I don't want to sound too pessimistic about the US job opportunities for international graduates but want to be realistic. CICS Careers would be a good place to check for more information. They have a dashboard on their website that shows what companies hired international students over the past few years.",

Recently, though, I've come across some mixed reviews, with some people suggesting that the program accepts 'just anyone' and primarily exists to support the PhD program financially. I\u2019d really appreciate some honest feedback from current students or alumni who have been through it. Is this true? How was your experience? Did you find the program valuable and worthwhile? And has it been helpful in your career? Any insights would be greatly appreciated!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Literally 10k out 1.2 million get into such schools. And out of those 10k, 1k will be for computer science. So 1k out of 1.2 million are in Tier 1 CS. Now coming to Tier 3, it\u2019s every other college that any one can get if you pay fee. Nothing special. No one in India knows their name. So you know the difference. The 8 GPA is out of 10. In Tier 3, getting 9.5/10 is also pretty easy. Getting a 4/4\n Is easy. The assignments are something no one cares and exams are normal. The tier 1 institutions have professors that are pretty solid. So, coming to UMass they have taken in Students from IITs CSE with work experience. And also a random student who hasn\u2019t completed their graduation yet, studying, with 3 out of 4 GPA with no research experience or no internship experience got in. This spring, there are lots of such cases. Literally people who couldn\u2019t find a job in India got into UMass. Where as there are also people who left job in FAANG and are coming to UMass. That\u2019s why it\u2019s mixed. The cohort size is fairly big, that\u2019s why I assume this happened. I didn\u2019t see any big rejects here in India. Every random guy who barely did anything got into UMass.",

People from tier 3 colleges have also worked hard, secured their jobs, and put in significant effort to write strong SOPs. In your story, you mention about 1,000 students, but there are also unqualified ones who got into NITs and IITs simply because of their caste. Those who didn\u2019t make it to NITs or IITs didn\u2019t lose hope; they worked hard and applied to US universities where they believed they had a chance, regardless of their background.\n\nAdmissions committees have access to the entire application and evaluate each candidate through SOPs and personal statements\u2014something you can\u2019t judge just from a quick profile overview. If you\u2019re heading to the US, it\u2019s time to drop the old mindset and be open.",

The reason he is taking it now is because he is doing an experiment to see if attendance has correlation with student grades. Toby Applegate is also just a really chill dude.",

They also don\u2019t come in everyday like they\u2019re supposed to, in order to take the trash out and wipe the sinks etc. I wonder if they\u2019re mad about us putting food trash in the bathroom trash, which we\u2019ve stopped doing. But the bathroom is getting really gross regardless and I don\u2019t know who to contact or who to talk to about this. I never see this custodian as I\u2019m always at class during the scheduled cleaning time but my other suite mates do know that they\u2019re bro coming everyday. Can I report them to someone? Or should our suite mates and I just suck it up and clean the bathroom regularly ourselves? (Which is technically not our job to do) ",

The problem is we\u2019ve been noticing that our custodian hasn\u2019t been cleaning the shower in weeks and it\u2019s getting very gross. They also don\u2019t come in everyday like they\u2019re supposed to, in order to take the trash out and wipe the sinks etc. I wonder if they\u2019re mad about us putting food trash in the bathroom trash, which we\u2019ve stopped doing. But the bathroom is getting really gross regardless and I don\u2019t know who to contact or who to talk to about this. I never see this custodian as I\u2019m always at class during the scheduled cleaning time but my other suite mates do know that they\u2019re bro coming everyday. Can I report them to someone? Or should our suite mates and I just suck it up and clean the bathroom regularly ourselves? (Which is technically not our job to do) \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "text": "*As this February 2023*\u00a0[article](https://www.boston.com/news/health/2023/02/22/massachusetts-xylazine-tranq-epicenter/)\u00a0*notes, the veterinary sedative xylazine (\"tranq\") is not only highly prevalent in Massachusetts relative to other states; it is also increasing at a more rapid pace here. The percentage of statewide fentanyl samples testing positive for xylazine, which as of early 2024 was a shockingly high*\u00a0***42%***\u00a0*- one of the highest percentages in the nation - as well as the number of fatal ODs involving xylazine, are both still increasing in Massachusetts.*\n\n*In terms of the distribution of xylazine within the state, as this May 2024*\u00a0[article](https://www.masslive.com/news/2024/05/why-western-mass-is-being-disproportionately-harmed-by-tranq.html)\u00a0*explains, Western Massachusetts, including Springfield and Hampden County in particular, has been disproportionately hit by tranq because its rich network of interstate highways serves as a drug distribution hub for the rest of New England. In addition, data from state and national law enforcement agencies show that the Greater Boston area also has an elevated percentage of xylazine-containing fentanyl samples.*\n\n***Note: UMass students should be aware that fentanyl, and by extension xylazine, have been increasingly found as contaminants in cocaine, ecstasy / Molly, fake \"Xanax\" bars, and even marijuana; thus, buying street drugs other than dope / heroin carries the risk of unintended exposure to xylazine and fentanyl.***\n\nIn the early 2000s, the veterinary anesthetic xylazine began to taint illegal drug supplies in Puerto Rico. From there, it spread to the East Coast of the United States, beginning in Philadelphia, where this so-called \"tranq\" dope attracted an ardent fan base.\n\nAt present, xylazine has been found in fentanyl and heroin samples from throughout the continental United States. It is most prevalent in the South and Northeast.\n\nDrug Enforcement Agency statistics indicate that in 2022, 23% of seized fentanyl powder contained xylazine.\n\n# Fast Fact\u00a0[\\#1](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/my-blog/hashtags/1)\u00a0- Xylazine is a Veterinary Tranquilizer\n\nXylazine belongs to a group of chemicals known as phenothiazines.\n\nSignificantly, this group of structurally related compounds also includes tricyclic antidepressants and the alpha-adrenergic agonist clonidine, a blood pressure regulator that is used to mitigate the Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and anxiety caused by opioid withdrawal.\n\nIn veterinary medicine, xylazine is used as a surgical anesthetic for horses, rabbits, and other animals because it produces sedation, muscle relaxation, and analgesia (decreased pain).\n\nPossible medical uses of xylazine for humans were investigated, but its side effects, particularly bradycardia (slow heart rate) and hypotension (low blood pressure), were judged to be too severe.\n\n# Fast Fact\u00a0[\\#2](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/my-blog/hashtags/2)\u00a0- Xylazine Boosts the Effects of Fentanyl\n\nThe vast majority of the xylazine available in the United States is combined with fentanyl in so-called \"tranq\" dope.\n\nWhen taken on its own, xylazine is unlikely to be particularly recreational.\\* However, when mixed with fentanyl, it increases the sedation, respiratory depression, and other effects of fentanyl.\n\n\\*During college, I injected veterinary xylazine; trip report available\u00a0[here](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/post/medical-grade-xylazine-product-review-pure-garbage-with-no-place-in-the-recreational-pantheon). In addition, I wrote about xylazine hitting the dope supply in my home city in Upstate New York\u00a0[here](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/post/rest-in-peace-gabapentin).\n\nMixing xylazine with fentanyl causes a \"nod\" that is much closer to anesthetized unconsciousness than to your average, in-and-out heroin or fentanyl high.\n\n# Fast Fact\u00a0[\\#3](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/my-blog/hashtags/3)\u00a0- Xylazine Increases the Chance and Severity of Overdose\n\nBecause it increases the respiratory depression and low blood pressure caused by fentanyl, xylazine greatly increases the risk of OD.\n\nBecause xylazine is not an opioid, Narcan \\[naloxone\\] is not effective in reversing xylazine overdose. However, Narcan should still be administered in cases of suspected OD because the majority of xylazine in the U.S. is sold in combination with illicit fentanyl powder and pills.\n\nThere is no approved antidote or reversal agent for xylazine overdose; treatment consists of supportive care involving mechanical ventilation in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU).\n\n# Fast Fact\u00a0[\\#4](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/my-blog/hashtags/4)\u00a0- Xylazine Causes Skin Sores That Can Lead to Sepsis and Amputation\n\nFor reasons that are not yet understood, in some users, xylazine causes widespread skin lesions that appear 24 to 48 hours after first use.\n\nThese ulcers begin as pea- to penny-sized, semicircular lesions found on the arms, legs, face, and other areas (see pic below). They grow rapidly for as long as xylazine is ingested, and they have a tendency to become infected.\n\nInfection of the ulcers can lead to sepsis, in which bacteria spread to the blood, causing multi-organ-system damage and death.\n\nThe rate of amputations is very high in xylazine users relative to users of fentanyl, heroin, and other illicit opioids not mixed with xylazine.\n\nOnce the user stops ingesting xylazine, the ulcers gradually disappear over a period of days to weeks (so long as infection is resolved and they are kept clean to promote healing).\n\nHowever, the sores can cause significant, long-term scarring.\n\n*Important Note: These xylazine sores are not related to route of administration. They appear whether the xylazine is snorted, injected, or smoked.*\n\n# Harm Reduction / Risk Mitigation Strategies\n\nIf you are using fentanyl in the United States in 2024, it is very likely that at least some of the dope that you are snorting or injecting contains xylazine.\n\nIt is imperative that you obtain test strips for xylazine, which are available for free from a variety of government divisions / agencies as well as nonprofit groups.\n\nIn New York State, for example, the Office of Addiction Services and Supports (OASAS) will send you xylazine test strips for free (order form\u00a0[here](https://forms.ny.gov/s3/Harm-Reduction-Order-Form); Narcan \\[naloxone\\] and other harm reduction supplies are available as well).\n\nIf you have recently ingested what you believe to be tranq dope and have even a single sore anywhere on your body, you need to go to a doctor and obtain a broad-spectrum antibiotic immediately. It is quite possible that life and limb depend upon it.\n\n# Carpe Diem Before There Isn't Any Diem Left To Carpe\n\nThe wave of fatal xylazine-fentanyl overdoses that the U.S. is currently experiencing is reminiscent of the period in 2015-2016 when fentanyl began replacing heroin in the U.S. illicit opioid supply, as a result of which addicts were dropping like flies.\n\nThere has never been a better time to get clean and sober - while you still have all four limbs and haven't sustained severe brain damage from an OD!\n\nUse the resources below to find a 12-Step meeting and / or an opioid maintenance treatment provider.\n\nAs always, feel free to use the \"Contact\" form or Instagram (concreteconfessional) to reach me with questions.\n\n**Buprenorphine and Methadone Provider Directories**\n\n[Find a Sublocade treatment provider (injectable buprenorphine)](https://www.sublocade.com/find-a-treatment-provider?utm_campaign=BR%20%7C%20PAT%20%7C%20Sublocade&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=find%20a%20sublocade%20provider&gclid=CjwKCAjwl4yyBhAgEiwADSEjeKV6iyO9CjXdSM4spnrNIQ6ZISsygNDUbY0Zhh4QEwLnGq4rYavCpBoCs4EQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)\n\n\\*Brixadi is another injectable formulation that you might want to look into\n\n[SAMSHA's Buprenorphine Treatment Practitioner Locator](https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/find-treatment/treatment-practitioner-locator)\n\n\\*In certain states, you might be able to obtain buprenorphine by e-consultation.

That being said, if you're testing a pill, you crush it, dissolve in water, and dip the test strip in the solution. If you still want to take the drug, you can drink the liquid.\n\nEven if you don't take recreational drugs, I urge you to get a narcan kit and learn how to use it; you might just save somebody's life.",

I just cant fit it into my schedule as it would be too much for me, so I was thinking I could just take it at a different college (community college maybe) during the summer so I can cut down on the cost, and just get it over with during the summer.\n\nI hear that you can't take Math 233 at a different college and transfer it over if you failed it at Umass already, but that does not apply to me since I have yet to take it.\n\nIf anyone knows how this works, please lmk the logistics. Is there a list of pre-approved colleges where I can do this? How do I apply to a course at a different college if I'm enrolled at Umass?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I do miss the back of the Hatch and the video game room right before entering the Student Union from the walkway from the Campus Center. \n\nI've always liked Burma Trail between OHill and Northeast.\n\nI loved walking around campus and especially the pond and the laughing ducks. There were many more ducks than geese then. I'd sit on the same stone benches that are there now. \n\nThe food in the DCs was good. The DCs were the only places the meal plans worked. I learned about lots of good foods my mother never made like cooked spinach.\n\nOHill was fine. Never saw any roaches and the heat didn't make noise but there was no off switch. Only thing wrong with Ohill was having a room mate. Co-Ed bathrooms worked fine until they were outlawed. \n\nThe maze was great fun. We'd go down there at night and smoke a bowl in the middle.\n\nI also loved riding my bicycle on the flat-lands going north and skinny dipping at Puffer's Pond at night. \n\nSOM/Isenberg wasn't much to look at. It was only half the size. The two ends were built after I left. The only place to study there was the library and that was full of stuffed shirts who actually wanted to wear suits to work when they graduated.\n\nBut the old Newman Center Cafe was a good place for group study when necessary and their $2 breakfast special included fried eggs, fried potatoes, toast and a drink.\n\nI enjoyed walking through the arts building walking from SOM/Isenberg to the Campus Center/SU. The Arts building wasn't glassed in at the steps. \n\nI can't think of anything that I really disliked except for a few specific asshole students that in no way represented even a small fraction of the student body. My first room mate blew the tweeters in my speakers twice. And one guy in a boarding house I lived in later on got drunk and tore a post of a staircase and whipped it at me because I was just there at the time.\n\nOverall my time there was great!",

The still forested section of the steep part of the hill going up to the observatory is called Prexy's Ridge.\n\nThe maze was located just south of alumni stadium. It was a chain link fence maze. There were actually two. The first one I know of was rectangular. That's what was there in the early 1980's when I went there a bunch of times. Later it was torn down and a smaller circular one was put up. But that didn't last long. Much later the sun wheel was placed on that spot.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hkea31c3rwxd1.jpeg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3d9b1dff4cc1eda7d31a52fe8096c31023423fe",

The path between sylvan and ohill is the rape trail. When I was a student the path was completely unlit and unpaved and they warned us to not walk it at night alone or we'll get raped. Afaik it has no other name, so I continue to use that name, when I refer to it. They need to rename it, and I have said that for years.\n\nThe goat trail that we used to scurry up behind UHS has also been replaced with stairs and a paced path, and they cleared a bunch of the trees.",

Arrives late night around 12:30 AM.\n\nBy bus Peter Pan's site would take you to NYC to then transfer to a partner's route from there to Buffalo.  Shorter would be taking Peter Pan to Albany and transferring to Greyhound or Trailways there.  Total time would be about 12 hours plus.\n\nOptionally use Peter Pan to Albany and take Amtrak's Empire Service from there to Albany.  The Albany to Buffalo time would be about 7 1/2 hours.\n\nPossibly the fastest would be getting to Bradley and flying out of there to Buffalo.  But prices I see for that run about $300 a flight.  By public transportation from Amherst it will take about 2 hours to get to Bradley, about an hour by car.\n\nAll of the trip times by public transportation will depend on how well connections line up.",

You need to fill out this form first: https://www.umass.edu/registrar/sites/default/files/PriorApprovalforTransferWork.pdf\n\nA couple caveats: the grade you get in the transfer course won't count towards your GPA at all, so this only works if you're retaking to knock off credits or prereqs, not to improve your GPA. Also, you can't use transfer credits as a way to get around the UMass repeat policy. So if you flunked a course twice at UMass, any transfer credit for it will be rejected until you get three-peat approval from your academic dean (and if you flunked three times, transfer credit won't be accepted at all).",

The pipes also need to move some to allow for expansion, but if they stick and then release you get a bang.  Sags can trap condensed water, and steam pops through eventually.  But UMass has reduced the number of maintenance workers in many areas of expertise, just enough to fix urgent problems in most cases.\n\nI grew up in a house with steam heat.  Had all of those sounds at one time.  But my father took care of leveling some sections that had sagged and replaced or added new supports, and most of those went away.  About the only sound would be some hissing of air being released from the vents as the system heated up.",

Taking the course elsewhere can get you the prerequisite, but not replace the grade.  UWW may be different and replace the grade, check that first.  UWW will also cost you about $2300.\n\nSo you have a choice of using the help sessions and tutoring available and possibly YouTube instructions to pass the course over the next 4-5 weeks, or spend a lot.  You might even consider a late withdrawal, that removes the requirement for having a low enough grade to retake the course.  But talk to an advisor first.",

                "text": "I lived there all 3 years I was in-person at Amherst. On a per-month basis, the prices are tacked to the cost of a double on-campus, and the extra expense comes from paying for months when school is out of session - you are paying for 12 months rent vs 8 month's room for a dorm. Subletting is available, and apparently when new management took over two years ago they started offering half-year contracts for people taking just one fall semester before graduation, so that might offset costs for you.\n\nIn terms of room quality - the walls inside apartments are relatively thin, so if the people in the other bedroom play video games loudly, puts the TV on max volume, or are too loud during...... two-person calisthenics, then you will hear it in the living room (it's a tolerable level if you stay in your own bedroom). But the walls between apartments are quite thick - during my senior year, my next-door neighbors frequently held large parties with loud music, and while the shared wall vibrated a bit, the noise level was relatively quiet and tolerable when they wouldn't turn the sound down.\n\nThe kitchen is sufficient for cooking full meals if necessary, just make sure not to set off smoke detectors, and the in-apartment laundry is a *really* nice quality-of-life feature. The in-bedroom living space is smaller than in a dorm; however you get a walk-in closet, a two-person shared bedroom, and a living room, so it never feels crowded if you keep your spaces clean.\n\nThe cost of electricity started to be a real killer in my last year there however - the first two years I paid an average of $40-$50/mo individually in electricity, which is comparatively nothing especially when everyone I lived with had a large gaming desktop, but Eversource jacked prices up last year and each person in my apartment was saddled with bills as high as $120 in the winter, as electric heat eats a lot of power.\n\n  \nI think one big draw is that unlike a lot of other landlords in the Amherst area, this is a professional management company, so they aren't slumlords, and have a handyman on relatively fast call if something is broken instead of expecting you to repair something yourself and pay for it yourself. They also have a gym that I never used, and a fire pit that's pretty nice to sit at once in a while.",

I picked UML initially because it was a 10-minute drive from home, it was the cheapest, and I liked the computer science department/floor when I initially toured there. I was also excited by all the opprturnies that uml had to offer to its students. How, 2 months in and I don't know if I made the right choice. I initially was a computer science major but switched to sociology because the way my computing professor was lecturing us and the information in that class made me realize that maybe comp sci isn't for me (I picked sociology because it was my elective and was the only class I actually enjoyed and felt engaged in). (I'm not taking the classes for my sociology major yet). Just the way the campus is laid out with it being so open and spread out is such an inconvenience and doesn't feel inviting to me. I don't have any desire to go to any school events (half of the time I don't even know they're going on until after on Instagram or from a friend) and I'm not a party person. With commuting for me, it's hard to engage in clubs because I have to think about what time to get back home so that the traffic isn't horrible (yes I know I live 10 minutes away from traffic from 1:30-5 is the worst here), I work every other day and those days tend to land on when clubs meet (at least the ones I'm interested in), and it's been hard making new friends who have similar interests to me. I just want to attend a school that has more of a closed-in campus and a better student population. I know umass Amherst is known for its parties and I've said that I'm not a party person, but I don't think I can spend 4 years here. I'm willing to dorm and understand that it's going to be a lot more expensive (my parents are paying for my tuition right now and I haven't told them about this thought yet and I'm a little bit worried about cost), I just want to know if anyone here who transferred here (especially from UML) was happy with their decision.\n\n(Sorry that this was messy, I'm tired and I just wanted to get this out before I forget. There also a chance that I might be experiencing burn out which could definitely affect my learning and college experience)\n\n\\*I also don't find my classes to be engaging. Even though I don't have any big lecture hall classes, I still dread going to all my classes (my smallest is 15 student and my biggest is probably around 30) except for my intro to Sociology because the professor actually makes the class interesting\n\n  \n\\*I'm also happy to hear from anyone on why they chose Umass Amherst (especially over UML) ",

There's a lot there.\n\nWith that being said I have felt disappointed by the sociology department at umass, but it may just be me. LOVE pretty much all the other social science departments they have. It would be a good idea to check out faculty in the socio department if that's something you want to keep pursuing. There will be a mixture of small seminars, medium size classes, and big lecture hall type classes.\n\nUmass amherst is good for social science fields if you really want to be exposed to a lot and have various opportunities. It's also a big research institution, and you'd get more exposure to various research projects, faculty, and grad students working on different things.  \nYou'd have a lot more to choose from in terms of certificates and minors as well- plus you'd be a part of the five college consortium and get opportunities from there.  \nGenerally speaking with gen eds and electives you'd have far more variety to choose from at Umass amherst-- if that's important to you.  \nIt has a rep as a party school but it's not hard to avoid parties. I must emphasize it's a big research institution, that is generally supportive of academic development, at least within the SBS majors (which include sociology and many more).\n\nWhatever you do, I'd say its important to listen to your instincts and try not to make yourself do something you simply are unhappy with. There's also value in trying new things even if you aren't sure about them.\n\nAs for the cost, I'm not sure if there is a large cost difference for MA residents between UML and UMA? I'd also argue there's probably more scholarship opportunities too? Depending on your financial aid situation you may be eligible for MA State grants, in addition to Pell grants, and sometime the school will do small grants based on financial need.\n\nPS...I felt like what you described and I ended up switching majors- and am having a great experience since.  \nIt's hard, but I hope you can figure out what works for you! Maybe it's worth simply visiting the school to start with?",

Guess it is not common. \n\nI will describe my scenario to you. I just transferred to UMA this fall, with aspirations to pursue a pre-med track. I was fixated on coming to Amherst and pushed third-party opinions to the side in regards to going to Lowell (my reason, I have no idea and looking back, I wished I would\u2019ve just listened to them because now I have to tell them that they were right). I knew deep down that Amherst was going to make me extremely uncomfortable for many reasons\u2014 the distance from home (i am very much a homebody) being in a long-term relationship, and the environment as well to name a few. I just continued to tell myself that the feelings would subside and i would acclimate to UMA over time. \n\nAs time passed, it most certainly did not get better. Things had just continued to get worse and worse\u2014not in regards to the school itself, more or less my personal life, but before UMA, i had never faced real adversity. Since then, I have come to strongly dislike UMA and even consider it to be a black cloud. \n\nAlthough these are my personal feelings and in no way, shape, or form is it the schools fault for my personal life issues. I will say that the school is not really transfer friendly, meaning that it is very hard adjusting as a transfer. They kind of just throw you into the fire and expect you to make it out scotch free. Apart from UMA being the \u201cflagship\u201d public school of Massachusetts, to me, the school does not live up to the hype. I just don\u2019t really see it. Yes, the facilities are nice and the professors are highly accredited. Those professors are everywhere though. Yes, Amherst is a top-tier school for research, and that was probably one of the only things that was making me hesitant to fully commit to my decision to leave. Overall, I decided that UMass was not for me, at least not at this point in my life. Had I went there from the beginning, maybe it would\u2019ve been different but you cannot live your life through what-ifs and maybes. I\u2019m grateful to have had the opportunity to experience UMass for this short period of time, but I am also grateful that I embraced the fact that it just was not for me. \n\nFor those reasons, i will be transferring once again in the spring to UML. \n\nOnce again i want to highlight that these are my personal feelings, and i am sure a majority of the students do not feel the same as i do. Best of luck, all i will say is make sure that you weigh all your options and that you are 100% positive with you choice.",

By establishing itself initially only on instate routes, under the regulations in place they got priority on passengers and fares between those cities and towns in MA over interstate carriers like Greyhound and Trailways.  Under the regulated fares and such, part went to Peter Pan even when Greyhound and Trailways carried those instate passengers over routes Peter Pan had been approved for.\n\nFor a number of years they were also a member of PVTA for the route between Springfield and Amherst.  That. included some buses purchased by PVTA and operated by them over those routes.  As a former driver for UMass Transit, that is one thing I took notice of.\n\nThey also have actively bought up their regional competitors.  That includes companies such as Arrow Coach, Bonanza Bus Lines, and Trailways New England.  That last purchase allowed them to expand to NYC.  Since then they further expanded routes to Washington, DC.\n\nFinally, the current head has actively lobbied against increased direct train service between Boston and W MA for most of the last 2 decades.

It may also be worthwhile getting bloodwork done, as some nutritional deficiencies can impact sleep quality and daytime energy levels.\n\nLastly, I recommend downloading a sleep-tracking app like SnoreLab.

There are two kinds of sleep studies available that I'm aware of- in patient hospital setting kind, and one where you have a device that you set up before bed and return the next day so they can read the data. What's covered may entirely depend on your insurance coverage/ type of medical coverage.\u00a0\n\nLots of things can impact sleep besides apnea, don't be afraid to ask for other things like blood panels.

Tuition and some fees are charged per credit up to 12, 12 or more is a flat rate.\n\nOne thing not mentioned so far:\n>Also how much does off-campus housing cost? for UMass Amherst?\n\nYou should plan for about $1000 per month in a shared housing situation, $1500+ if you want to live by yourself.  You can find slightly cheaper places, but many are already leased at this point in the year.  The possibility does exist of finding a sublet where someone is leaving after this Fall, possibly with some rent reduction from the person leaving so they can get out of their lease.\n\nThere are about 200 spaces of grad housing on campus.  They are in a privately run apartment opened recently, they are on the expensive side.",

That does not account for all of the transfer students - perhaps less than half, the rest will be placed in open room spaces throughout the rest of campus.\n\nEven before they went to using halls in both Sylvan and Southwest 2+ years ago, the one hall used in Sylvan only housed about 300 transfers, and since then part of that hall has been used for freshmen.  They usually accept about 1000-1100 transfers each Fall and a few hundred in the Spring.\n\nMany of the events specifically for transfers students in those two halls are in the Fall, but they may have some in the early Spring.  As for making friends, just wherever you meet people.  It might be in your dorm, it might be through participation in one or more of the many clubs, or it might be through study groups connected to your courses.",

I've always looked around to see if any girls were in the bathroom, at least wherever I walked around. One time when I didn't see anyone around when using it, but only minutes later an RA knocked on my door, saying they got a report that the person in this room number had just used the girl's bathroom.\n\nI got this conduct charge for it.

Never heard the daughter's side of it though.  New head issued a decree that all bathrooms would be single sex, and made it a condition of employment for RAs to enforce that.

I made that other post to get opinions before sharing this, seeing split opinions on this, and some posts with jokes like \"believe it or not straight to jail\" when asked if X is against the rules.\n\nThe girl's bathroom is much closer to my room than the boy's one. I've always looked around to see if any girls were in the bathroom, at least wherever I walked around. One time when I didn't see anyone around when using it, but only minutes later an RA knocked on my door, saying they got a report that the person in this room number had just used the girl's bathroom.\n\nI got this conduct charge for it. I whited out details and slightly edited it to remove and obscure personal details.\n\n![img](agiitjxvicwd1)\n\nIt's apparently a big enough deal for some girl to call an RA about it and for them to immediately come to my door. So I'll have to only use the boy's bathroom from now on. I really feel like they should renovate all the dorm bathrooms to be like the ones in the Student Union building: gender inclusive, and stall doors from floor to ceiling, and maybe cameras outside the stalls too if safety is an issue.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Each apartment consists of 4 single bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and a common room with kitchen area.\n\nAs for your chances, it entirely depends on what you get for a random priority number.  Assuming you are a junior or senior for next year, you will have initially priority for single rooms including in North.  If you have a low number, a very good chance.\n\nBut if you are not making backup plans by looking for another place off campus, strongly suggest you do some between now and room selection next Spring.  The reality is that after giving 2nd years priority for shared rooms and setting aside space for incoming freshmen and transfers there will be about 3500 spaces on campus for all others.  The only other option might be applying for Fieldstone, that would be a similar cost to living in North.",

When I lived in Orchard Hill in 1991, you'd mostly use the bathroom specific to your gender, but the unwritten rule was that you just use the closest bathroom for middle-of-the-night peeing, and it was fine. Now that gender mixing in bathrooms is more common in various ways, it still doesn't bother me. As long as everyone is behaving appropriately, I don't care where they pee. At this point, I no longer see the relevance in gender-segregating bathrooms. And then where are you supposed to pee if you're non-binary and someplace without a gender-neutral bathroom option?

For example they admit students to alternate entry paths such as\u00a0[NU.in](http://NU.in), Oakland and London campuses just so that they can keep their Boston campus GPA and test score averages (which are the ones they show publicly) impressive. I personally also think they use test optional to make their numbers look better.\n\nAs you point out, last year, test optional, only 27% of applicants submitted SATs, which resulted in a composite 25% score of 1460.\n\nHowever if you go back and look historically, in 2019 when scores were required and 55% submitted SAT scores, their 25% composite score was 1390.  \n\nThere are a lot of reasons schools are choosing to drop test optional but I don't think you'll ever see Northeastern doing it because it helps them out too much.",

RIGHT???? i don\u2019t fucking know at this point, i just can\u2019t stand this shit. i wonder what y\u2019all are like at your own homes. \n\noh, also, just one more thing. when you don\u2019t flush the toilets guess what the entire fucking bathroom smells like\u2026 PISS AND SHIT?? WOOHOO ISNT IT WONDERFUL?? fucks sake i\u2019ve had fucking enough of everything.\n\ni could keep going on and on but this is all i\u2019ll make you read if you\u2019ve made it this far. thanks for listening to my rant.\n\nTLDR: stop pissing on seats and leaving toilets unflushed bc i\u2019m gonna go insane\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Right now, I'm in a South Asian history class, and to be honest I find all the course content interesting but especially the economic aspects of it. Also, after talking to a lot of the people in my club who major in economics, it sounds like a way to a really nice job with the government. My primary issue is that I'm not good at math. I did not do well in AP stats despite the fact I understood the gist of the content. I can definitely understand how math connects to businesses, social outcomes, etc. and that's where I shine, but I have trouble memorizing all the formulas and exceptions to certain rules etc etc. I'd like to hear from someone with potential experience or some level of wisdom that could help me out here lol",

I'm thinking of declaring an economics major because I find it interesting. Right now, I'm in a South Asian history class, and to be honest I find all the course content interesting but especially the economic aspects of it. Also, after talking to a lot of the people in my club who major in economics, it sounds like a way to a really nice job with the government. My primary issue is that I'm not good at math. I did not do well in AP stats despite the fact I understood the gist of the content. I can definitely understand how math connects to businesses, social outcomes, etc. and that's where I shine, but I have trouble memorizing all the formulas and exceptions to certain rules etc etc. I'd like to hear from someone with potential experience or some level of wisdom that could help me out here lol\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I ended up talking to the building manager who told me that the old SU had to come down because it was full of mold and people were getting sick.\n\nI've since made 3 multiple day visits staying in the hotel and I've come to like the new one though I miss the old Hatch with the bar in back. And I would have liked to have walked up the stairs from outside the Hatch up the the main doors one more time.\n\nMore shocking to me is that this mural that was down the escalators in the bottom floor of the campus center at least since 1980 has gone missing. They can't find it. I saw it last in 2013. I don't know when it went missing and the building managers have no idea. I hope it's found.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jb2vumx750wd1.jpeg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93f48f018e529a2b04c447baa790370fcc4daaa5",

I was told the building isn\u2019t up to code, likely because there\u2019s only one door in and out of the third floor, and there\u2019s no landing in front of it. In case of a fire, someone could run out and tumble down the stairs. I went up there just before spring break in March 2023, but when I returned after break, the area had been locked. I\u2019ve heard you can contact UMass Physical Plant for a private tour of the third floor, though I\u2019m not sure how long that process takes. Someone who went up there mentioned they had to walk between floor beams because the flooring had been removed.\n\nI also visited Clark Hall, across from Fernald, where the third floor is also sealed off. There are two entrances\u2014one leading to a plywood panel, which had been opened at one point (you can read more about it here: [comment by WhiteMountainMan](https://www.reddit.com/r/umass/comments/g2tahw/anyone_got_any_umass_ghost_stories/)). The other staircase leads to a wall, but you can still see where the stairs continue to go. It was only supported by two wooden beams, so I was too scared to climb it. I can dm you a photo if you'd like!\n\nEdit: Here is a link about a part of Clark Hall being closed off for good: [https://umass.edu/pubaffs/chronicle/archives/00/05-19/letters33.html](https://umass.edu/pubaffs/chronicle/archives/00/05-19/letters33.html)\n\nSomewhere else I read that the these studios were located on the third floor so it makes sense why it was closed too.",

That policy was that only the groups such as UVC, Collegian, Earthfoods that were designated as \"agencies\" would get space after the renovations.  Nothing was said to leadership of other RSO groups that already had been given space that this policy would go into effect until after the renovations were complete.\n\nAs for 200 groups, only a much smaller number had spaces assigned to them before the renovations.  RSOs losing space that I know of included the Muslim Student Association, UM Science Fiction Society, Anime and Manga Club.  The first used their space both as an office, and as a private place members could use for daily prayers.  The other two have lending libraries that are currently in storage as they have no permanent place to operate out of.  The Science Fiction Society as a RSO just celebrated its 60th anniversary, for most of that time they had assigned space and ran a lending library.\n\nBartlett is only being used as temporary space, the administration made no promises of space there after the SU renovations for student activities related groups.  It is still to be torn down, about 15 years ago during scheduled renovations to Bartlett they found structural problems that were determined to be too expensive to repair.  They finished some repairs, cancelled the rest of the renovations, and originally had it scheduled to be torn down in 2017.  The problems also were the driving force behind the renovations and addition being done to South College to provide a new office space for the English Dept and some others from Bartlett.  They also took two floors from Du Bois Library and moved the English Writing Program there about 10 years ago.",

So no idea what they are thinking of doing going forward.  They may be thinking of using part of the old Newman Center building for temporary space.  For example, recently I was looking at google maps and happened to click on that building.  It gave it as the address for the Outing Club.  Haven't verified that yet, may if I come to visit the campus in the near future.\n\nOh, and if you happen to go on campus, one sign of the damage to Bartlett shows on the exterior walls of the office section.  They bolted channel irons across the brick facing to keep it from falling.",

This is also different than the previous garage system which gave you a little bit of a grace period ater you paid for your ticket to get out of the garage.\n\nBecause this is new, because the monitoring system is different in the garage than in the spaces, and because they waited a full month in which you racked up 24 of these charges to notify you, I would go to parking services and talk to them.

But in the past permits have been based on the image they show on this page - https://www.umass.edu/transportation/permits.\n\nBut now it is not enough to have a permit on a vehicle, whether genuine or a forgery.  Enforcement was changed to license plate scanning 10 or more years ago.  So no plate in the system, or not listed as having a permit for the lot it is found in, a ticket would be issued.  They have at least two different vehicles equipped with the scanning equipment, they just drive through the lots and issue tickets when a violation pops up.  There is even a requirement that cars be parked with the plate visible for those with just a single plate.\n\nAs a note, I misplaced my permit one year after they started this and didn't have it on my car for a couple months.  Never got a ticket because the plate was in the system for the lot I parked in.",

Many students are unfamiliar with it, even though we often use ParkMobile. Usually, there's a grace period like before. Since the new monitoring system is different, students need time to adapt. However, I fully acknowledge my violations and am willing to pay for my October violations. I hope Parking Services can consider my proposal.\n(I could have been more clear and more humble but they limited my length to be 500 characters)",

I had some stuff happen in freshman/sophomore year with my grandfather and grandmother both passing away very close in time, who were my main connections to being Puerto Rican and practically raised me, so it hit me hard, and affected my school work heavily (hence the low gpa).\n\nWould love to know if I have a chance of getting in or what I can do to improve it.

You get to list preferred residence areas and type of room, but not select a specific room.  I don't know if they are able to do placement of roommate pairs for the Spring, but if you find someone you can list each other when putting in your housing preferences.  I would imagine they will have some fully empty rooms.  Otherwise you may get placed into an empty bed in a room with a roommate who is already there.\n\nAs for RAPS, nothing for you to get to know about.

                "text": "I just graduated this summer, but I was here because I wanted to. I returned to school after dropping out of Westfield State years ago. \n \nHow old are you? Your post makes me think you're a freshman just out of high school and not quite sure what you want to do with life yet. Totally normal for a lot of us. When I graduated high school in 2006, I felt I **had** to go to college and there were no other options. I dropped out because I was so tired of school at that point, I was the first person in my family to attend college and despite school feeling like the 'only' choice for me, I couldn't do it. I do regret that decision, but at 19 I just didn't have the sense of appreciation and focus that I have now for education. Going to school in my 30's was a lot harder, but I learned more, got better grades, and had a much deeper appreciation for what the classes were teaching me. I loved my experience at UMass.\n\nI see a few ways you can look at it:\n\n* **Option 1** - You're getting school out of the way even if you don't fully appreciate it or care about it. You're checking off a box that will be important in your later years, even if you don't have it quite figured out yet. That's not ideal, but totally valid. Enjoy the college experience, I wish I did when I was young before life was filled with responsibility. I know people in sales who have Psych degrees, IT Technicians with History degrees. A specific degree will help land your first job, but it doesn't doom you to that field or role forever if you so choose. You'll always benefit from having it completed and can do grad school later if you find your calling for something new.\n\n* **Option 2** - You drop out to 'find your purpose'. You miss the college experience while your peers are the same age and living the same student life you are. You start working at Starbucks or whatever and maybe you find something more interesting. In a majority of cases, you will hit a ceiling eventually in your career progression because of the lack of degree - either as a job requirement or specific professional and personal refinement that comes with a college education naturally. You'll now find yourself, like I did, trying to fit school between parenting and a career, all the while doing it alone because your friends got their degrees years ago and can't relate. \n\n* **Option 3** - You attend school for a year or two doing GenEds and find what you want to do. Change majors, maybe spend an extra semester finishing but now you have a path forward you care about and aren't going through the motions. Hell, even transfer to a different school. Either way you made progress while you took time to figure it out. \n\n* **Option 4** - Drop out and be a plumber or electrician. Good careers, good money, but you'll lose the social experience that comes with college which I regret passing up, personally. Alternatively try your hand at being a social media influencer or OnlyFans model, success not guaranteed. \n\nI took Option 2 and wish I stuck with Option 1.",

I graduated community college two years ago and genuinely considered calling it quits on college there; I am so ready to just get myself a job, move somewhere nice and start a new life - but after I graduated I told myself to really think about it until I was sure about what the next move is. I almost joined the Air Force (still is for sure a solid option for after I graduate with my BA), but I decided to apply to colleges just to see what I could get. Truth be told, I don\u2019t have many friends; my family hardly exists, and my resume doesn\u2019t look great. I knew I needed to do much more before I could feel satisfied with my own self-worth. I ended up being accepted into some good schools, but ultimately UMass gave me the best financial aid reward (money is unfortunately the biggest factor); plus this was actually my top choice back when I was a teenager before I chose to stick with community college. Also, all of my credits from community college transferred to my degree, so I have less than two years til I graduate. So I really don\u2019t see any other choice \ud83d\ude02 why wouldn\u2019t I do this?\n\nSo, basically, yes I feel like I have to be here.

On the occasional night I have stomach issues and can't eat dinner properly, I look forward to grabbing a humble snack at the Grayson vending machine. The snack being Garden Salsa Sun chips, of course. Tell me why I went down just now to grab a pack and after A MONTH of having an uninterrupted supply of sun chips, I go down to see it GONE from the vending machine.\n\nI must specify:\n\n* These were the ONLY chips gone from the vending machine\n* I had bought these 24 hours hours prior, and as i do every time, I checked how many were left and there were at LEAST 4.\n* This means that within the span of 24 hours, FOUR PEOPLE bought out my garden salsa sun chips??? AND NO OTHER CHIPS????\n\nI hope these are restocked immediately, and I request that the Sun Chips not be COMPLETELY DEPLETED once again. These aren't even the most popular chips. I am very upset.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ucr6dxnmjuud1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e4c0774f4426e1295fae2619f4359245e7d8590",

On the occasional night I have stomach issues and can't eat dinner properly, I look forwards to grabbing a humble snack at the Grayson vending machine. The snack being Garden Salsa Sun chips, of course. Tell me why I went down just now to grab a pack and after A MONTH of having an uninterrupted supply of sun chips, I go down to see it GONE from the vending machine.\n\nI must specify:\n\n- This was the ONLY chips gone from the vending machine\n\n- I had bought these 24 hours hours prior, and as i do every time, I checked how many were left and there were at LEAST 4.\n\n- This means that within the span of 24 hours, FOUR PEOPLE bought out my garden salsa sun chips??? AND NO OTHER CHIPS????\n\nI hope these are restocked immediately, and I request that the Sun Chips not be COMPLETELY DEPLETED once again. These aren't even the most popular chips. I am very upset.\n\n![img](ucr6dxnmjuud1)\n\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Many of the years since they have struggled to get the players, and have many losing seasons.  Or there was a winning season over all games, but a losing season in conference.  Last year was one of the exceptions.  If they can keep that up, then UMass basketball may have recovered after nearly 3 decades.\n\nI will give Camby two points.  He did eventually come back and complete his degree in 2017.  And he reimbursed the school the appearance money UMass had to return after NCAA vacated UMass's 1996 record in the playoffs.\n\nP.S.  I have not been to a game in Mullins in years.  Is the 1996 Final Four banner still hanging in the rafters?  The AD at the time ordered it kept up.  I knew someone with a broadcast engineer license who worked some games back about 20 years ago, they were instructed to not show it on camera during games.",

And the team radio station still hypes up the 96 season during the promos for basketball sometimes.\n\nCamby and Coach Cal should not be getting this much blame for the basketball team. They obviously have mostly been meh or not good since both left, but the athletics department definitely deserves more blame for not finding the right guy to help truly bring UMass back. And maybe Frank Martin will help pushing them forward... but oh wait they'll also be in the MAC soon enough and that won't help sway people to play here",

Calipari especially, he recruited players that may have been able to play, but many caused problems during and after his time as head coach.  He probably would have received NCAA sanctions, but had ducked out after the 1996 season to coach the NJ Nets.\n\nThere have been other college programs where he has left just before problems came to light.  So UMass is not the only one where his hands are dirty.",

No I know he broke rules. But it's ridiculous how the NCAA made billions upon billions and all the big brands could do this, so idk why people go hard on them to this day.

That may be what you are seeing, but check with an advisor.\n\nWhatever the reasons you can not continue in the Spring, basically what you are faced with is withdrawing from being enrolled as a regular student.  You could then enroll in either just classes or into a degree program through UWW.  There have been limits on how many credits you could enroll in each semester, that usually means being considered a part-time student.\n\nYou may be able to put together a plan through UMass FLEX - https://www.umass.edu/flex.  Again more to talk over with advisor(s).\n\nDepending on what you are getting for financial aid, that is almost certainly going to be impacted.  Talking with someone from the aid office can give you an idea of what can continue.  But overall, aid for part-time and online programs is less available.",

In some of the older buildings it is further complicated because they use the steam to heat circulating water.  In the Summer the same water is cooled with chilled water to provide air conditioning.\n\nBesides all that, most of the campus buildings are 50+ years old.  Old valves stick, break, and otherwise cause problems as they switch over to heating buildings.\n\nOne disadvantage you have in your rooms now is almost everyone has switched to LED lights.

(Most reputable colleges and universities I am aware of are the same--no \"pre-med major.) You can major in whatever you want before medical school as long as you take the required courses. In fact, many medical schools appreciate seeing majors other than the standard biology. You will use many different skills as a doctor and beginning to develop those as an undergrad is important.\nUMass is a big place with the benefits of a large research university (over 500 student organizations, research opportunities, diverse courses and majors). We benefit from being in an exceptional area for education and students can take courses at Amherst College, Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke, and Smith College, each with their own unique environments and opportunities. We are located in a quintessential college town. \nBeing a public institution is also special. We have a mission to serve our Commonwealth, but do that in part by exposing our students to diversity in many forms. UMass students have a history of activism and caring about the world. The ICONS program brings together students from several of the science and technology majors to grapple with real-world issues such as sustainability and climate change.",

The workload on assignments tends to ramp a bit and you might end up a little swamped if two of the bigger homework assignments line up. If you end up doing this, it'd be pretty important to be extras disciplined and start assignments early.\n\n240 is basically a statistics class with more CS flair. If you're good at math, 240/linear shouldn't give you much trouble. If you aren't good at math then maybe leave one off for later. IIRC linear doesn't block many electives.",

My best piece of advice is two fold. If you are good academically and don\u2019t mind slipping in a couple Bs on your transcript in exchange for speed running a bunch of classes, do it. If you want to make sure you can ace all of the classes, getting ahold of the midterms (which is easy for core classes) is a great way to validate your expectations for the material you will be expected to master.",

They instituted the no guests policy after 10am due to sporting events in previous years getting too crazy but since most of our friend group lived in O-Hill it was a non-issue, except for my sister who didn't live in O-Hill but wanted to go.\n\nThe day of a few of us were taking the bus someplace and they were trying to brainstorm ways to sneak her in, and jokingly I was like \"you could stick her in a ResLife moving cart and cover it over with blankets and stuff kinda Metal Gear style\", but they thought I was serious and said it was an amazing idea.\n\nI didn't think they'd actually try it, but honest to god that night they grabbed a moving cart, stuck my sister in it, filled it with laundry, and walked up to the security desk and just said they were doing a big load of laundry, security dude apparently bought it and they successfully snuck her in.\n\nNow again I'm not saying you should try this, I think it's a fluke that it even worked at all, but like I said it makes for a good story.

Normal weekends were 8pm - 3am, Halloweekend (and Blarney weekend) typically ran 24/7 security, beginning at 4pm on Friday and ending Sunday at 3am.\n\nThe only real solutions we had were to give our friends lookalike U-cards from generous people on our floor and pray security didn\u2019t pay much attention. So we\u2019d have our friends show up Saturday night, go straight from the car to the dining hall, then try to get them in the dorm. If successful, we\u2019d stay in and pregame until a party began and then go out and stay out til 3am Sunday when the security would finally leave.\n\nFrankly they do make it pretty difficult to pull off.\n\nedit: your best bet is to make friends with a chill security guard. Even if they don\u2019t let you bring your bfs in, they could certainly give you useful info about the security schedule in general. Best of luck",

The past two years there have been no zero guest policies for halloweekend maybe just stricter security but Blarney is where the university experiences a lot of bad press and chaos so they care about that weekend way more.

So its also up to what sort of security monitor you get I guess, and also of course if you can sneak people in or my best suggestion, come outside hours of security. Also I believe that it is 4-3 on Fridays and Saturdays because of the need for extra security hours, possibly Thursday too, but I might be completely wrong on that as well. I think umass will send an email out to students about halloweekend expectations and it will discuss all of that so make sure to read that, cause I might be wrong on hours and guest policy on here!",

You would be ahead of many.  That was realized just as they were finishing the FAC 50 years ago, they relocated the music library at the last moment to provide those.  That came back to haunt them years later.  The music library and its collection was moved to Du Bois after the roof over it started leaking badly.  Repairs were delayed for several years.  When they asked about moving back into the space, the architectural engineer in charge of the repairs to FAC told them they couldn't.  The music library shouldn't have been relocated to where it had been at construction time, the floors had not been designed for that loading.",

I know the stories about Du Bois not being designed for the weight of the books but have read contradictory accounts on that related to the pieces of brick falling off. I also think that I read at some point about water problems. I know that the water mains broke around 1981 and flooded the basement. And I think it was the summer of '84 or '85 that I saw them lifting more I beams into the library. \n\nYes I've walked around the Arts building I'm sure a thousand times but it's hard to get a handle on how large it is given it's really strange shape. Certainly worth finally exploring especially after reading about the renovations in the last few years to the 4th floor.",

But also half a floor of bound music scores and other related music reference works.  There is some other material as well, but that gets beyond what I am familiar with.\n\nI don't think there was any other building the music collection might have been in between FAC and Du Bois.  But initially they had it on one floor of Du Bois as a temporary location and still identified as the \"Music Library\".  But after they knew it wasn't going back to FAC they moved it to part of a different floor.  The temporary location had used some classrooms on the floors without regular shelving.  There was yet another move about 10-12 years ago.\n\nThe rest is a mix of building problems.  FAC just plain leaked a lot of places, and it got worse as the building aged.  The underground section under the plaza was the first area.  You may remember the reflecting pools they kept empty as they were still there in the '80s.  They were kept empty as that was one source of leaks.  The repair project resealed a lot of places and included the copper sheet roofing over the slanted roof sections that is there now.\n\nThe bit about Du Bois being not designed for the weight of the books is an urban myth that got started sometime.  The supports for the bricks were not designed to support the weight.  Originally the exterior of the tower was designed to be clad with limestone panels that would have been half to two thirds the weight.  The general contractor also had the subcontractor substitute cut bricks for the bottom row of each panel which were not as strong as the bricks spec'd in the plans.  Water problems in Du Bois stem from under-spec'd plumbing materials, and continue still.\n\nBasically almost any building erected on the campus during the '60s and '70s has had problems related to poor construction or materials.  There was even a commission appointed to look into the issues because it also happened with other building construction for the state elsewhere.  The report exposed corruption, kickbacks, contractors colluding on bids, and more.  It helped make Billy Bulger's political career, the previous President of the State Senate had to step down, Bulger became the head of the state Senate after that.\n\nGetting to those I-beams you saw being moved in.  Those were not for reinforcement or repairs.  When Du Bois was built in the early '70s it went over budget.  They proceeded and built it anyways, but they deleted the 3rd and 6th floors, the 6th elevator, and escalators between the entry level and the lower level floors.  After the partial closing of the building in the late '70s related to the bricks spalling, there was a contract to investigate the cause of the problem and indicate needed repairs.  The legislature eventually budgeted money for repairs to the building.\n\nReplacing the brick facade was determined to not be practical and too expensive, they just put up the perimeter fence to keep people out of the falling chips zone.  The main entrance got extended out from the tower and covered over.  The rest of the repair budget money went to fix some plumbing problems and also was used to install the missing 3rd and 6th floors.  Those I-beams were the supports for the new floors.  They were needed because they couldn't connect them to the structure the same way as the other floors were during construction.  If you visit the library, you can go to the 2nd or 5th floors and look up and see the difference from every other floor in the tower.",

I guess at the time I thought it was water conservation. I never knew that the building was under it or that the water was leaking in. I'm really impressed that the building is under there. I must be huge. \n\nEven more reason to finally explore the place.\n\nFor someone who is new to the school, this is what that area looked like in the 1980's and also note that where the box office/lobby is, was just a straight walk-through to the steps on the pond side. Thousands and thousands of people would cut through there in a single day. It was a major route across campus until it was enclosed with glass in the mid-1990's.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bud5r7rc2cud1.jpeg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5db885752d3d857a359b9f0ac38b3c8e5b0281d1",

I had read that it was enclosed because it was creating a wind tunnel but I never thought that was the reason. I suspected administration didn't like people riding their bikes down the steps or something like that and I suppose it makes sense that the building have a lobby. But I do miss the open pathway. \n\nFrom 1985 Index. Remember the giant black french fry? And no bridge to the east side of the island.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4p4batgwucud1.jpeg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ad27c8edb3ff9eafb3d6d7abe3f1d7ab1ba9d91",

But compared to other wind tunnel locations on campus, the FAC was a minor one.  However glassing in the area created a common lobby area, not just a small area outside the entrances to the performance areas like the concert hall.\n\nAs for the history, 40 years on campus and I kept my eyes and ears open from an interest in history.  Got to talk with a lot of different people involved in working on and maintaining parts of the campus as I worked various jobs.",

There are two blocks of dorm rooms reserved for transfer residences in Sylvan and Southwest, enough for about 35-40% of the transfers. The rest get housing assignments across the multi-year halls in all areas of campus housing.\n\nYes, your second year of housing is not certain.  After reserving spaces for transfers and freshmen, and giving 2nd year students priority for space, there are about 3500 spaces left for juniors and seniors.  Off campus housing is a bit less tight, an additional 600 spaces exist in a privately operated apartments on leased campus land.  Fieldstone is expensive, but some students have the money to live there, leaves more less expensive places available in the area.",

Cops arrived in a couple of minutes. They contemplated putting the goose down then and there, but someone across the quad had a video camera mounted on a tripod, so they didn't want to take the chance of them shooting a goose being caught on camera without the opportunity to provide the full context. To make a long story short, they just called animal control, at which point I left.",

The next I recall noticing is the one between the Old Chapel and the pond.\n\nMy own speculation was that they were mainly put up to make things safer for women at night. But I've wondered how safe it would be to stand by a call box if a stalker was loose.\n\nI think that they were put up around the time that Burma Trail also got a trimming. Now the sides are clear perhaps 20 feet so no one can just hide in the bushes and jump out. If I recall correctly, back when I was there the brush and shrubberies on Burma Trail pretty much came up to the paved trail on the north side making the trail potentially unsafe at night for a person alone.\n\nI do wonder how much use the call boxes get now with cell phones.",

(I know job finding is easier said than done so best of luck\u2026)\n\nBack to the question, the program used to be better but we did lost some great professors so I don't know how it is rn. From personal experiences good and bad professors are 70/30, and the difficulty of coursework are heavily dependent on the professor so kinda just have to hang on there (also grad thermo which is a core class is known to be awfully hard). Knows too less to comment on research, but my experiences have been fine (Do avoid bad PIs) (likely the same professors as the above 30). \n\nHope it helps!",

That means in the late morning and early afternoon it would have been out of the south. With this in mind, and the fact that your shadows are directly behind you I'd guess you're looking south standing on the west side of a N/S road, with that building on the East. \n\nNow the bad news is that I have no idea what campus looked like in those days, what buildings have since been torn down, etc. \n\nThe building in the background is too short to be a Southwest lowrise. Those are 4 stories, and that one looks to be 6. Its definitely not anywhere in Central or Northeast, those buildings are very distinctive. I agree that its not Ohill, the windows are wrong. Ohill buildings have pairs of thin windows. It definitely looks like a dorm building. Its not sylvan, sylvan buildings are too tall. \n\nAny of this helpful? MY experience is based off of google maps data from 2022 and my own recollections from the late 2010s, so It may be a building that was long gone by the time I got there. That being said, a 6 story building is fairly tall, especially now that we know its right on the east side of a N/S street.",

Dropping a course means it pretty much never existed, it doesn\u2019t show on your transcript or academic record.\n\nWithdrawing from a course means it *does* stay on your transcript and your grade from the course is a W. It does not affect your GPA, but it can affect your Satisfactory Academic Progress which may result in issues with financial aid, depending on other courses you\u2019ve taken. You need to earn credits in 67% of your courses to remain eligible (there are other parameters as well). Deadline for this is 10/29 and it sounds like it may be beneficial for you.",

Our facilities are pretty good, we have we have woodshop, Fablab, CNC, and studios are open 24hr. I enjoy most of our professors who are pretty knowledgeable and because the program is a bit smaller you get to know them and your classmates really well.

I think it gives a lot of opportunity for creative freedom and allows students to build both an artistic and technical foundation for the field. \n\nThere are some things though that I\u2019ve heard among my classmates, like the fact that they feel that the program is too design focused and that we should have more focus on practical building codes and practices. However you do have to recognize that this is a four year non accredited undergrad program, so it\u2019s likely not all students may be following the track to become a licensed architect. If your child is looking really looking to be licensed as their main goal, then they may want to look at 5 year NAAB accredited undergrad programs. Umass does though, offer a NAAB accredited masters program that is great too so it\u2019s easy for umass undergrads to just follow through with a masters here and get their accredited degree here as well. \n\nI\u2019ve also heard that the CAD program that is primarily taught here (Rhino 3D), is a bit outdated and isn\u2019t necessarily the common practice among firms nowadays, but we also do have classes that teach other cad programs like Revit. I\u2019ve also spoken with a graduate that has said that Rhino is useful for general CAD skills though, and that the skills are easily transferable across programs.\n\nI personally really like the feel of a smaller architecture program because you get to know all do your professors really closely by face and name, and you become close with your classmates and can easily collaborate and lean on each other for help. \n\nLike any architecture program though, it\u2019s really time consuming and they make you pay for all materials and digital programs. The biggest thing for me is having to pay for the CAD program and Adobe creative suite out of pocket. The cad program alone was like 200 bucks but you do get to own the license to use it so it\u2019s a one time payment. The Adobe is a monthly payment though so it does a number. \n\nI think umass was the right fit for me and I absolutely would choose it again. Was definitely the best choice I made.

Like others have said, the first whole year is geared towards the gen ed requirements. I personally did not find them beneficial, but they are required. You will be required to take a few art classes  too.\n\nThe workload is a lot. You have 3 hour studio classes typically 1-3:45 and are expected to complete all work by desired deadline\u2026You need to prepare yourself for long studio nights (sometimes all nighters) and buying lots of materials throughout the years. You will need money for printing too. You should be comfortable public speaking or get used to it because you will have to present your projects to your peers, professors, and guests such as architects from outside firms. \n\nMany of my friends were in Isenberg, and their schedules were much different than mine. Time management is key to passing. You have to go to every architectural class because missing one class can set you back a lot. There are no tests, just mid/final presentations. \n\nThe professors are very nice and understanding, but they will give you a whole project to complete in one week, which caused many to drop the program overtime. The program itself is small compared to the others on campus. I would say there was 40 or less in my class, but you do get to know everyone since you spend 75% of your life in the studio building. \n\nThe facilities are amazing and it was a privilege to have access to everything they offered. I also minored in BCT which I wish I had majored in originally. I would say unless you know you want to be a licensed architect, possibly major in something else\u2026everything is also on the computer. They did teach us hand drawing plans, elevations, etc but only at the very beginning of the program. Now that I graduate and I went into construction, I wish I had majored in BCT. Lots of the architectural projects are art focused\u2026.really consider what you want to do because this major is not for the weak!! It will make you feel burnt out and I\u2019m not just saying this. People will say other majors are similar but seriously think about if this is what they want to pursue. Overall it\u2019s a lot\u2026.",

I was just wondering how anyone else in 250 studied for their exams, how you did, and what else I can do to prepare for the exam and overall the class, as I am struggling a bit in certain areas. thank you.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Yeah it's a community college and there are many students who slack and struggle but the teachers for calc especially the higher up ones calc 3= umass calc 2 engineering and calc 4=umass calc 3 engineering are superior and smaller classes.

If there happens to be an empty room in the hall, that they might use.\n\nOnly reasons to move out are if changing rooms for the Spring, doing a semester abroad, or leaving UMass.\n\nDo take anything of value with you, and anything you will need during the break.  Unless you opt into paying the break housing fee you will not be able to get into Gorman during the break.",

Without paying the break housing fee students also have to leave the dorm by 10 AM the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.  For Spring Break it is by 10 AM the Saturday before if I recall correctly.  In both case they can not return until 10 AM the Sunday afterwards.\n\nThey also are not going to move someone in temporarily for those breaks either.  At least they have more spaces now for break housing than before.  Four halls plus all of North Apts. are designated as break housing for sophomores through seniors, two are designated for freshmen.

Ask questions with a genuine curiousity for what they do and see if it piques your interest. Make sure you give them all your resume as well. \n\n\nSince you're a new major, I would assume you haven't taken any exams yet. Go to the Society of Actuaries website, Be An Actuary website, and read everything about the different exams, pathways, and potential niches you could go down as an actuary (life/annuities, health, retirement/pensions, property & casualty). \n\n\nVisit the r/actuary subreddit; there is a ton of great information there.\n\n\nI would recommend taking your first exam (exam P) in January, or sooner if you feel like you have a solid background in probability. If you think you'd prefer taking a more finance-heavy exam, you could sit for exam FM in December. The main point is to commit to taking an exam, put it on your resume that you intend to take one, which helps companies know you are serious about pursuing the career. \n\n\nI cannot recommend Coaching Actuaries enough to study for the exam. It has a hefty upfront cost, but it is worth every penny especially considering that UMass refunds you the full price of your first 3 exams + study materials for those exams.\n\n\nThere is an actuarial club on campus as well (Gamma Iota Sigma) that has weekly meetings on Tuesdays at 7:00 pm. You should attend a few meetings to meet some other actuarial students and talk to full-time actuarial analysts or credentialed actuaries. \n\n\nAlso, I'd recommend just going on LinkedIn, searching \"UMass actuary,\" and connecting with alumni who seem to have successful careers as actuaries. Explain your situation that you are a new math major curious about the profession and that you'd love to connect for a 15-30 minute conversation to learn about their pathway through the career. Not everyone will respond, but it is worth it to see if it really interests you. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if I can be of any assistance to you.",

At times I wish they would, there have been dust storms off them after they dry out in late Fall and there is no snow cover with strong winds.  But the recommended time for Fall manure spreading is after the soil surface temperature has dropped to 50 or lower.  With some of the cool nights recently that should be happening right about now.",

I know what you are talking about when you talk about the dust storms on Rt 116. For whatever reason I thought that they did at least plant rye there during the fall. I guess I will pay more attention or ask. \nMy husband\u2019s family has farmed our land for over 100 years (also dairy, tobacco, and potatoes). He is the one who told me that while some fertilizer may be harrowed in when they plant a cover crop, it isn\u2019t much. Certainly not enough to cause a smell. Not like the massive cow manure that is put into the soil in the spring. Thanks for your considerate answer!",

Idk your app tho but I\u2019d say getting volunteer work or even joining a club or starting a book club LITTERALLY anything would help you more than just retaking the sat. \nIf you take a good number and make it great\u2026 cool! In my opinion it would be better to add more categories and diversify what your piece of paper has. Retaking the sat changes a number adding a heading of volunteer work or clubs/hobbies with a solid essay is more fun and would help more imo.

Sure, we\u2019d all like $400 a month for housing and a $42 an hour wage! But if you think UMass in its current capitalistic state would ever agree to that? Keep on dreaming!\n\nThey sent out an email coercing GEO members to not ratify our recent contract negotiation with UMass. They are interfering with how members should vote, using scare tactics and coded language rather than allowing us to get the raise we deserve (from $32 to like $38 an hour). \n\nAidan, Chris, and Isuru have done this without the consent or agreement of GEO leadership. This should be grounds to have those three removed from their position ASAP. They have their own agenda and are willing to drag us all down with them. \n\nAll I\u2019ve wanted since September last year was a raise lol \ud83e\udee0 I feel bad for those who graduated in May with no raise and most likely no hope of back pay either. \n\nPosting for transparency and exposure.

But after a year of living here with no renewed contract, I worry they will continue to put this off until next year again. Which means another set of graduate students will have worked here for a year and graduated with no raise.\n\nIt really is something that has me torn. I\u2019d love the well-increased salary and a monthly housing stipend. But my checking account is also telling me I can\u2019t continue to wait several more months to go through an impasse when I could use the raise and back-pay now.",

When I applied to UMass Amherst in 1979, one of the selling points UMass Amherst made was that even 100 level classes were taught by Ph.D faculty professors and not grad students. During my undergrad time at Umass, 1980-1984, every class I had was taught by an actual Ph.D professor.\n\nWhen I then started Grad School I was offered a teaching assistant position. The Professor still taught the class.  As a teaching assistant, I held review sessions, help to create the exams, held office hours for students with questions on the material but neither I nor the other teaching assistant ever taught the class.\n\nI wonder when that change was made.\n\nMy son now attends UMass Boston and he has a grad student teaching at least one class and when I heard that I was a bit surprised.",

Well, he withdrew from college after 2 or 3 weeks. So, I know there is a refund of about 50% of what I paid.  I had paid $6k already for just tuition. Room and board is a whole separate thing. He withdrew without my knowledge, but he did go through the proper channels and luckily they didn\u2019t pull out any money for the month of October. Since my bank info was the info set up on the coin account for direct deposit, will the school refund that account? Or will they send a check to my son?  I don\u2019t want him having that money, cause it\u2019s mine and I worked and saved for 18 years to be able to send him to school and not have him be in debt for the rest of his life.

You can not see anyone but everyone above you can see you and same you may feel private but it echos and everyone hears you.\n\nIt has been awhile since I have been at umass but what I did if I was looking for a quiet place look for all the donated class of benches. Lot of them are in wooded areas away from everyone. There used to be a lot between the old fine art building and central dorms. I don't know if rape trail still exists but there was a reason it was called that because it was at the time it was audibly too far away from the majority of the population. \n\nThere are some gyms that have many floors below ground that may still be private or blocked off. Boyden and Totman gym has tons of floors underground if they are accessible. Just be careful Totman also has a room I think for nuclear days that only unlocks from the outside. My brother got locked in their once exploring.  That is too  isolated. \n\nStudent campus roof used to be accessible by stairs. Lgrc and t tunnels. The older the building the more random places there are. Between track and field and football field has a path pretty quiet also a way back in the day I snuck into football games with students a few years after being alumni. There was more, but lots may have changed. There is a tunnel between the soccer fields and Whitmore building but I think they have that locked down for administration members only.",

        "text": "Hello all. I'm a high school senior looking to apply to UMass Amherst sometime this fall. However, I'm having some doubts. My stats are nothing expectional, but I really want to attend this school. \n\nMy weighted GPA is a 3.37. I have straight A\u2019s from semester 2 of my sophomore year to present, but my freshman grades are pretty bad, which has impacted my overall GPA. \n\nI'm hoping a holistic review will forgive my bad grades, as I went through various unavoidable struggles during that time. My essay is about said struggles. It\u2019s narrative style. \n\nI was advised by my counselor to not apply with my SAT scores and go for Early Action. My scores were poor (1090) because I have bad test anxiety and missed a large portion of each section due to running out of time. I *was* going to retake the SAT in November and opt for Regular Desicion alternatively, however.

Biology is a broad and one of the biggest majors at umass, due to them having no major switch requirement and also being part of one of the largest academic colleges at umass.\n\nHowever, If I had to guess based off your GPA and SAT though, I would say it would be more likely you will get waitlisted or denied a spot. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s generic, but many people write about their struggles in their common app, whether it\u2019s family dying, financial hardship, poor education systems, and many more. I won\u2019t say they wouldn\u2019t consider it, but it doesn\u2019t strike me as something that would make me (if I was in admissions) accept a student right away. Your ECs are also lacking, but again, that is something they take into account with said struggles of the education system the applicant comes from and also how some districts may not have the funding to host extracurriculars. I know people who were waitlisted at umass and they did things like present their scientific research at MIT or worked in labs.\n\nGood luck applying, I\u2019d definitely try to work on your SAT though and polish your application to be the best it can be.",

I'm a high school senior looking to apply to UMass Amherst sometime this fall. However, I'm having some doubts. My stats are nothing expectional, but I really want to attend this school. \n\nMy weighted GPA is a 3.37. I have straight A\u2019s from semester 2 of my sophomore year to present, but my freshman grades are pretty bad, which has impacted my overall GPA. \n\nI'm hoping a holistic review will forgive my bad grades, as I went through various unavoidable struggles during that time. My essay is about said struggles. It\u2019s narrative style. \n\nI was advised by my counselor to not apply with my SAT scores and go for Early Action. My scores were poor (1090) because I have bad test anxiety and missed a large portion of each section due to running out of time. I *was* going to retake the SAT in November and opt for Regular Desicion alternatively, however. I'm not yet sure which route to take. \n\nI was a SkillsUSA chapter leader last year (and hopefully this year when the time comes around) and also won first place in a district competition, if that counts for anything. I just joined NHS as well.  \n\nIs there hope for me? I'm highly interested in UMass Amherst. I know realistically, my chances are low, but I want to be able to do anything I can to bring them up. \n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated.

I got accepted to UMass as a political science major with some decent scholarships. The fact that you did SkillsUSA and NHS will also help you a lot. \n\nUMass is test optional, so feel free not to submit your scores unless you\u2019re sure they\u2019re going to help your chances. It won\u2019t hurt your chances to not submit them. You can retake the test if you want, but in all honesty you probably don\u2019t need to. \n\nTLDR; I\u2019m not an expert but I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll get in. Good luck",

The end of the HFA ceremony was the beginning of the queueing time for grads in the SBS ceremony. The HFA ceremony ran over time by a LONG time, so I had to leave early and SPRINT at max speed to reach SBS before they started their ceremony.

Zero protein, zero fiber, zero vitamins. You can\u2019t say all of this is fine with a balanced diet, but pizza is inherently an unbalance food. If you were to balance it out, you would need to eat a proportional amount of protein with it, along with some sort of mono unsaturated fat. If you did that You would probably be overeating the amount of calories your body can healthily digest. You would replenish your glycogen stores with the carbs, overload your blood with lipids, and everything else would be stored as adipose tissue. This is how people gain weight. I eat pizza, I love pizza, but I eat it seldomly because I know it is inherently not healthy for me despite containing things that are part of a healthy diet. \n\nYou grew up making pizza, that\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019ve spent the last 12 years coaching strength training and nutrition. Contextually yes you need all food groups. If the context is pizza you are not eating all the food groups.

Overall the food quality has gone down for many reasons some of them being having less people working and more things being frozen which makes it more easy to cook it and serve. I remember working in Frank before Covid hit there were a lot of students working and had more full time staff working, after Covid the number of people working decreased by like 40-50% overall and the food that they had before got changed like the dough got changed into frozen crust along with things that they can buy frozen and make it quickly and easily.",

Often the first semester is the hardest for a transfer student -- everyone else in class already has their study buddies etc., you don't have a peer group, the standards and systems are all different from your old school, etc. If you come here, be sure to take advantage of all the advising options open to you, and be very sure to get out there and meet people!",

The Spring 2021 Greek scorecard - https://www.umass.edu/greek/about-community/scorecard - shows blanks for all entries except conduct violations which lists 8 as the number.  Alpha Sigma Phi is not shown on the Fall '21 scorecard at all.\n\nEdit - But it appears the national organization considers the chapter active.  Could be that UMass suspended the chapter but their charter was not suspended by the fraternity.  Would not be the first national organization to ignore local findings of violations.  It means Alpha Sigma Phi can not participate in campus events such as recruiting or get representation in the fraternity/sorority council.",

All it means is that they\u2019re still an active national chapter, there\u2019s just not much anyone can do to hold them accountable. They can recruit [underground] per se, but sororities will generally avoid registered events with them. They may have rejoined the IFC, but I\u2019m unsure.\n\nEdit - Doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019ve rejoined. They\u2019re not present on the IFC Instagram page in pictures or infographics.\n\nEdit #2: The fraternity that was raided for coke was AEPi back in 2021. They were suspended/had their charter revoked (unsure of the actual outcome), and I suppose are able to return. I\u2019ve heard rumors from my sibling that they have a house right now\u2026 although, this could all be underground. Big national fraternities LOVE to have presence on big state campuses. It\u2019s hard to give up a charter like that. Most organizations will look to re-charter after 4ish years.",

As I mentioned they already were on an interim suspension and 8 violations were listed for the Spring '21 scorecard.  In addition the national organization changed affiliation to FFC from IFC which is now known as NIC (North American Interfraternity Conference).  Anyway if they are continuing as an unrecognized fraternity at UMass, they may own or have a long term lease on the chapter house.  If they keep things under control, then they may continue.  But I recall all too well the number of houses closed down in the late '90s and early 2000s by the town for building code and health code violations.\n\nThe UMass page lists that the AEPi charter was revoked by the national organization, but going to AEPi.org lists the chapter as \"Active\".  Sounds like some shenanigans going on to me.  The national organization also switched affiliation from IFC to FFC during COVID, and currently FFC is not listed by the UMass office as a recognized one.  So returning may need recognition of FFC as an organization by UMass.",

Now the Blue Wall feeds a lot of people though not even close to a DC. When I was there the Blue Wall was a Bar and it had an actual Blue Wall and was only around half the size. Harvest was a study hall.\n\nI don't recall the DCs being particularly busy unless you went at peak hour. And even then it was the lines. Seating wasn't a big problem. I mostly ate at Franklin and sometimes Worcester. I almost never even went into Southwest.\n\nFun trivia, I saw the band Boston play in the Blue Wall.

Unfortunately that has done nothing (and I did that today).\n\nI have messed with most if not all the settings before- typically I can change the Wireless mode into 2.4GHz mode then back into the default Dual Band mode, which the WiFi then works after that, although that temp fix has stopped working as of today. Occasionally I needed to change some of the other settings and it would work, like changing the Throughput Booster to Enabled. Currently though, everything is at the default setting.\n\nI have had this issue exclusively at UMass though, over summer break at my house the WiFi never cut out and disappeared like it does here constantly. I am actually tempted to get a newer WiFi card and simply replace the one inside of this computer, to see if that fixes anything. But that is money I don't really have lol.",

I've already started looking at how the device is actually being set up in windows, looked through event viewer as well.

The university parking office usually does not have enforcement around at night.  Instead of calling the university police who would ticket and tow, residence staff have been given these notices, they leave one and take a picture of the illegally parked car.  That gets sent to the parking office and an enforcement officer issues a ticket.  So instead of a $50 ticket and a $200 tow, just the ticket.  Even if online it is valid, as valid as red light camera tickets are.\n\nThe university collects directly on tickets issued to cars belonging to students and staff.  All others can be sent into the court system, it is a state university.  Tickets not paid by students or staff lead to eventually getting towed, not getting a permit the following year, and in the case of students, not graduating.",

Basically, hackers gain access to an institution's servers (one that has high credibility or would otherwise pop up high in search results), and can use it to redirect people to their websites. In the most sophisticated/subtle of these attacks, it can be rather tricky for IT admins to even notice that they've been hacked, since hackers might include code tracking what users had searched and redirect them to either the appropriate site (e.g. UMass webpage) or to their illegal website (e.g. online drugstore).

Poor performance in two previous takings of a course will generally NOT be sufficient justification for a third attempt.\n\nhttps://www.umass.edu/engineering/office-student-affairs/engineering-forms-requests-and-regulations/third-repeat-three-peat-cours\n\nSo I would be prepared to discuss any outside problems you faced that caused you to not do well.",

You already have an automod that can respond to people, why can\u2019t you use that automod to just post the resources people have repeated thousands of times and then close/archive the post? I swear every other day we get the same post about how someone wants to make friends, and everyone responds with the same 5 answers.\n\nOn the other hand, I think you should really ban the ppl who shitposts (at least hopefully I assume they are) about dating or whatever else they are. I was a lurker here for most of my undergrad and really I\u2019ve never seen this many posts about trying to hook up with people or trying to find whatever girl they found in the dining hall or whatever else occurs. \n\nShould also consider megathreads for chancemes and new student questions but I digress \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Of course I took that route down to campus many times when I was living on Orchard Hill in the early 1980s but I never knew that it had a name, much less such a unique name. \n\nIt was a paved path by the early 1980s but I wonder if at one point it was a dirt path. It could have existed well before Orchard Hill dorms were constructed.\n\nThe attached image is a screen shot from a campus map titled \"2019\\_PortraitWayFindingMap.pdf\" that I downloaded from the Umass website probably over a year ago. \n\nI wonder if there is any record anywhere on why this path has such a different name and if it existed as a dirt path prior to the dorms construction what was completed in 1964.\n\nI've googled it. The only mention I've found is a few references at UMPD that there is a Help/Emergency phone on the trail. So UMass recognizes that as the official trail name.\n\nIt's a curiosity.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uyygfa7fhdrd1.jpg?width=2650&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9564d47231b61af41d29f78c9cacf608698ac00\n\n  \n",

Of course I took that route down to campus many times when I was living on Orchard Hill in the early 1980s but I never knew that it had a name, much less such a unique name. \n\nIt was a paved path by the early 1980s but I wonder if at one point it was a dirt path. It could have existed well before Orchard Hill dorms were constructed.\n\nThe attached image is a screen shot from a campus map titled \"2019\\_PortraitWayFindingMap.pdf\" that I downloaded from the Umass website probably over a year ago. \n\nI wonder if there is any record anywhere on why this path has such a different name and if it existed as a dirt path prior to the dorms construction what was completed in 1964.\n\nI've googled it. The only mention I've found is a few references at UMPD that there is a Help/Emergency phone on the trail. So UMass recognizes that as the official trail name.\n\nIt's a curiosity.\n\n![img](uyygfa7fhdrd1)\n\n  \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm doing great in classes and often find myself with free time and an urge to explore. \n\n\nI have a bike and a car on campus so I'm down to explore anything.\n\n\nI'm very much into urbex - I would love to explore all the secret nooks and crannies of the campus, get to each tunnel, roof, secret room, whatever it is. I have stumbled across past posts but the campus is constantly changing so I'm unsure what still stands and what doesn't. I understand a lot of this information is not to be shared openly, so if you'd like to DM me any information or directions I'll be sure to keep that information to myself to protect any remaining secrets.\n\n\nAdditionally, I also have a car, and would love to explore Western Mass and the surrounding area. It can be anything from an exciting hike with a great view, abandoned buildings, fire towers, great restaurants/food/stores/exhibits, historical features, cute towns, anything goes. You could even drop me some coordinates and I'd go check them out. Again, I understand some of these may be well kept secrets so anything sent to me through DM will be kept private.\n\n\nI've been eyeing some hikes in NH that lead to plane wrecks or other such artifacts of history. Driving into CT, NH, VT, RI, NY is not out of the question.\n\n\nDon't be afraid to suggest a well known spot or restaurant; I'm not looking strictly for secrets. I simply love to explore the world and try new things. \n\n\nPlease comment below or DM me about anything I should go check out.\n\n\nThank you!",

Which means that it's kinda like a time capsule. Occasionally the door gets left open for whatever reason and then you may enter, but I've never managed to explore up there the times I tried.\n\nThis is all from memory of a deep dive I did into campus history years ago so I might be a bit off but there's posts similar to this one I've commented on going back 5 or so years with details about this and other places on campus. I have a small list (that truthfully needs updating, I'm gonna get to that in October) of urbex spots on campus.",

For leisurely hikes, the Mount Holyoke range is great, and some of that trail network even crosses all the way through to VT and CT. Near Mt Norwottuck there is an old Cold War era missile command bunker. It's owned by Amherst College now and you can walk around the perimeter although the inside isn't accessible to the public. There's also great mountain bike trails right there up Bare Mountain. The horse \"caves\" on the back side of Norwottuck were a rebel hideout during Shay's Rebellion. Skinner Mountain in Hadley has a nice summit house, and the wreck of an old WWII bomber that crashed up there. The location is not public knowledge as it is a grave site. Mt. Tom in Easthampton has a quarry and an old abandoned water park and ski slope, although I think most if not all structures have been removed at this point. In Sunderland you can go see Buttonball tree- widest East of the Mississippi. New England falconry in Hadley will let you rent time to fly a hawk. If you feel like driving a bit, you can do the leaf peeper thing right about now. Rt 2 is nice and scenic on the way out to the Berks. The Appalachian Trail also crosses through the Berkshires in the westernmost part of the state, or you can drive to VT to access it. Mt Greylock out that way is the tallest peak in MA. The Bridge of Flowers in Shelburne Falls is a great date spot, and you can go tubing down the Deerfield River from there. It is closed for repairs this year, though. You can also do some whitewater rafting on the Deerfield River. If you're into fly-fishing, Chesterfield Gorge is an awesome spot. VT has great ski mountains. NH has the very challenging White Mountains to hike, although you really shouldn't trifle with those. Mt Washington in particular gets crazy weather patterns and is one of the absolute most dangerous mountains in the US. It has killed many people. I would go with a guide if you're a complete noob to the outdoors.",

I'm doing great in classes and often find myself with free time and an urge to explore. \n\n\nI have a bike and a car on campus so I'm down to explore anything.\n\n\nI'm very much into urbex - I would love to explore all the secret nooks and crannies of the campus, get to each tunnel, roof, secret room, whatever it is. I have stumbled across past posts but the campus is constantly changing so I'm unsure what still stands and what doesn't. I understand a lot of this information is not to be shared openly, so if you'd like to DM me any information or directions I'll be sure to keep that information to myself to protect any remaining secrets.\n\n\nAdditionally, I also have a car, and would love to explore Western Mass and the surrounding area. It can be anything from an exciting hike with a great view, abandoned buildings, fire towers, great restaurants/food/stores/exhibits, historical features, cute towns, anything goes. You could even drop me some coordinates and I'd go check them out. Again, I understand some of these may be well kept secrets so anything sent to me through DM will be kept private.\n\n\nI've been eyeing some hikes in NH that lead to plane wrecks or other such artifacts of history. Driving into CT, NH, VT, RI, NY is not out of the question.\n\n\nDon't be afraid to suggest a well known spot or restaurant; I'm not looking strictly for secrets. I simply love to explore the world and try new things. \n\n\nPlease comment below or DM me about anything I should go check out.\n\n\nThank you!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And there might still be some departments/offices in Northeast.\n\nIt's so dumb they don't want to build new buildings for 1st and 2nd year students AND also not up the acveptance rate, because we all know that if they build them, they will accept more and not relieve the housing crunch",

There are also some nice trees to sit under across the parking next to the water tanks\n\nIf you're in the mood for a cool spot, at least while the leaves are still on the trees, there is a wild tree at the bottom of the path between Baker and Orchard Hill. Go inside the branches and there is a large circular open area where you can sit and no one will see you.\n\nI've always enjoyed the benches under the trees on the east side of the pond by where that tree is growing in the pond. The path by the east side of the pond gets a lot less foot traffic than the path on the west side. Perhaps because that east side path is the last remaining unpaved path on campus. Beware of puddles and goose poop.\n\nThe walk up Burma Trail from the back side of the Life Sciences building, past the Chancellors house and up to Orchard Hill is usually a nice and peaceful walk and a good workout to work off stress. \n\nAs mentioned above, the bottom floor of the Campus Center is generally quiet unless there is a conference event. At the bottom of the escalators turn left towards the bathrooms and there is a room with tables and chairs where the women and men's room entrances are. It's a place you can study. It's almost always deserted there.\n\nIf you live in Southwest you might consider moving to a less densely populated residential area. I think I read somewhere that Southwest holds some record for the most densely populated area by some measure. No dorm is going to be quiet but at least other dorms don't get the reverb from all the other dorms so densely packed and people coming and going 24 hours a day.\n\nThe path across the field between Sylvan and Orchard Hill are a nice walk if construction on the new pavilion is finished. That area also has paths for a Frisbee golf course and there are mountain bike paths to walk in the west side of the hill.\n\nIn terms of coping strategies from the over-stimulating environment that a big school like Umass can be, consider taking up wildlife photography. Get a long zoom camera like the Canon Powershot SX70 or used older models like the SX50 and go out looking for birds. It's amazing how focusing on bird sounds can be so calming and takes your attention away from everything else going on around you. \n\nLet us know when you find your favorite quiet places, OK?\n\nClass of '1984.",

There are two main feeds from the power grid coming into the campus, rarely do both go out at the same time.  So some buildings are connected to one feed, the rest to the other.  Plus there is the power generated at the steam and power plant.  As part of building that plant which was completed 15 years ago, they installed a coupling to feed both sections if one of the main lines into campus was down.  When it works, it takes a few minutes to cross over power.  It sounds like it didn't work or couldn't be used this time",

I did love going home though, to see my pets and enjoy the peace and quiet of the suburbs. It made me appreciate my home more since I was coming from either O hill dorms or a crappy student apartment. However when I was assaulted my senior year I went home every weekend after that. I was done partying and done seeing people so I just wanted to go to a place that felt safe, and unfortunately UMass didn\u2019t feel safe anymore. Now I miss it and remember the best times, but I don\u2019t regret protecting my peace at that time. I think if I couldn\u2019t have gone home I wouldn\u2019t have been able to preserve any good memories from that place.\n\nI guess my point is, definitely try to enjoy your weekends at school! But if you know someone who goes home a lot, there might be a reason they don\u2019t want to share with you, so don\u2019t immediately write them off as someone who hates UMass or doesn\u2019t like socializing.",

Instead you went full speed at me, plowed into my NON broken leg, causing me to swerve out of control and almost fall down, using my BROKEN LEG to try to balance myself, probably injuring it more and increasing my recovery time. Not only did you ram into me, you proceeded to SPEED OFF and not even check if I was ok. as if you didn\u2019t just DRIVE INTO A HUMAN BEING. WHO WAS ALREADY INJURED. now both my legs are killing me and I can barely walk. so whoever you were, I hope you have the worst day and have someone drive into you too. all of you guys on the electric scooters who act like youre in nascar seriously suck. I\u2019ve seen so many people getting hit or almost hit. SLOW THE HELL DOWN.",

I fractured my ankle and i\u2019m in a cast. I use a scooter with a seat to get around. I was on the path near worcester dining (going 5/6 mph) and had people directly to my right, I saw you coming (probably going 15 mph or above) but I obviously couldn\u2019t move, I braked hoping you\u2019d do the same and MOVE SINCE YOUR LEG ISNT BROKEN, but no. Instead you went full speed at me, plowed into my NON broken leg, causing me to swerve out of control and almost fall down, using my BROKEN LEG to try to balance myself, probably injuring it more and increasing my recovery time. Not only did you ram into me, you proceeded to SPEED OFF and not even check if I was ok. as if you didn\u2019t just DRIVE INTO A HUMAN BEING. WHO WAS ALREADY INJURED. now both my legs are killing me and I can barely walk. so whoever you were, I hope you have the worst day and have someone drive into you too. all of you guys on the electric scooters who act like youre in nascar seriously suck. I\u2019ve seen so many people getting hit or almost hit. SLOW THE HELL DOWN.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Do you expect a girl to fall out of the sky and be interested in you? To start making out with you because you're in an elevator together? Unfortunately it boils down to how you carry yourself- which also unfortunately frequently depends on class- but more importantly confidence and listening skills. Either wait and let it happen on its own (something guys our age can't do because the internet and media directs us towards a bullshit stoicism but internal loneliness mindset) or go out of your way to make it happen.",

The best way to meet people, male or female, is through discussion in person. There\u2019s thousands of people on campus, how do you expect to stand out if you only brush by them for a second, a nobody in their life until you make that first step of initiating contact. Sure you can try and do something like talking over social media, but personally you don\u2019t feel the vibe no matter how much lols or emojis you send them. There\u2019s also the fear many people have of being creeped on through either stalking or social media, so many people do not typically try to socialize through that.\n\nSure you could try something like discord, but what are you gonna do when you meet in person? What if it\u2019s just a catfish? What if you misread the vibes completely and they just wanted to be a friend?\n\nI did not meet my partner through a dating app. We met through a club we shared mutual interests in, and from there we talked and talked and talked until we were both interested in each other. I did not go in strong expecting to be in a relationship, or do anything that would make her fall for me. We just naturally started gravitating to each other, and eventually the feelings blossomed. \n\nI also am a bit weary of your jealousy, I mean no offense but it comes off as incel-like. Just because a guy is surrounded by girls doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re \u201cbagging\u201d them or \u201cgood with the ladies\u201d. They could, and most likely are, just friends and like I said, share common points they can talk about. Life moves at different paces for people, and some people are just comfortable being with mainly female friends, while others may have a male majority friend group. Both are acceptable, as long as it doesn\u2019t breed any hatred/troublesome behaviors.\n\nForget the focus on getting girls. Live life how you wanna live, do the things you wanna enjoy and people, whether male or female, will come naturally. Go put yourself out there, I\u2019m not saying you have to become like a eboard member of a club, but at least show up. Go do what you wanna do, and I believe you\u2019ll naturally come to find that you\u2019ll meet the right person at some point.\n\nGood luck.",

However, what got me out of this slump was going up to the one woman that was considered out of my league: lunch lady, hall monitor princess and neolithic fertility goddess Mrs. Sullivan. Her lips, her hips, her stature, all of it towered over me with seductive authority; my ambitions only kept at bay by societal limitations preventing a love as pure and burning as ours to flourish. To hell with that! Here is my advice:\n\nWalk up to her with the authority that made lust after this naughty temptress of yours, and repeat these words verbatim:\n\u201cGirl, that vajayjay is PUN-GENT. I can smell that from down here, god damn! I\u2019m tryna see what those cajones of yours can do. So would you let this little mischevious gremlin take a little dolphin dive?\u201d\n\nThis love-potion-o\u2019-mine may seem off putting or forward at first, but as proof of my work, I will have you know that Mrs. Sullivan and I are preparing for our third, and we are expecting this one to be a scholar, seeing as the first two were less than neurotypical, shall we say.

If you plead guilty, you will just pay the fine and send back the infraction notice along with a check. I would strongly recommend that you go to the hearing after pleading, not guilty And taking a plea agreement from the prosecutor. The burden of proof is always on the university, or the state, to prove guilt. If there is no proof via a photograph or surveillance footage or a failed breathalyzer test, they have no way of showing that you werewith an open container. If there was body cam footage, you have a right to ask about that. But always go and fight because typically cops never show up to the hearings and that is what leads to a plea agreement.

In the 1980s enforcement was done by security guards of the campus Dept. of Public Safety, UMPD and its officers were the other part of that department.  The security guards also did building security across campus.  Around 1990 the state was having some budget problems and changed how benefits for state workers were paid for.  As part of that each division of the university was made responsible for all costs of their operations.  So part of the security force was transferred to Parking for doing enforcement.\n\nBasically at that point most UMPD officers treated parking enforcement as \"not my job\", and had to be reminded they at least had to do it after 5 PM and on weekends.  So they will do it for cars parked at handicapped spots for instance or in 24 hour spots.  I also have seen them come out and ticket and/or tow in the evenings in the past when large numbers of cars parked on Camus between Goodell and the library in the evening.  That is both a no cars zone and a no parking area.\n\nP.S.  Parking Garage charges 7 days a week.  The metered lots are officially between 7 AM and 7 PM Mon-Fri, but enforcement past 5 PM when the Parking Services office closes can be spotty.",

They also shuffled around who manages it and some inactive clubs still remain listed while new clubs aren\u2019t added, however it\u2019s a good first step to finding clubs you may wanna join.\n\nI would look next at the UMass Discord Hub, which is only accessible via a verified umass email. Granted, a sizeable portion of the \u201cclubs\u201d listed are typically not real clubs or are relics from the COVID era, so many of them are not in use. There are still some clubs that use their discord, but not many. However, it\u2019s a good place to find people with similar interests if they\u2019re active, or again, cross check with campus pulse to see if they have any events listed at all or even exist. Some clubs (like esports) are mainly fully online anyways and typically only meet online.\n\nThe next best place (and probably last place) is Instagram. Most clubs will use their instagram to get word out about events coming up, and that\u2019s where you get most of the info about clubs. The UMass instagram also does a story post about events coming up as well.",

If you approach people\u2014and take opportunities to crack jokes and make comments, and take bold steps to stay in contact with people or continue to be around people, and push through a feeling that you don\u2019t belong without letting that feeling bog down you\u2019re confidence\u2014you will get rejected, insulted, ridiculed, ignored, etc., which are all scary and uncomfortable experiences. But the flip side of putting yourself out there is that you\u2026\u2026.make friends (ta daaaa!!!!). \n\nBy putting yourself out there, you\u2019ll find that the people who give you shit for being who you are, and for just giving certain vibes that they don\u2019t like\u2014those are the people you don\u2019t want in you\u2019re life. And on an even simpler note, if people don\u2019t want you in their life, they will reject you. That\u2019s scary, but it\u2019s okay; they don\u2019t want you in their life, and you likely don\u2019t want them in your life either, so it\u2019s good. IF you put yourself out there, you will naturally converge with the people who appreciate you for who you are. \n\nAlso, you mentioned frat parties. I don\u2019t know if you truly enjoy club life, and I don\u2019t wanna assume, but it sorta sounds like you feel like you SHOULD enjoy that kind of life style, which isn\u2019t true. Truth be told, you will find very little human connection at a frat party, and if you\u2019re looking for real friends, and genuine human connection, and to have a good time in ways that you truly enjoy (not that you feel an obligation to enjoy), frats aren\u2019t the direction to steer in. \n\nAnyways, obviously I don\u2019t know you, and I\u2019m running off of some assumptions in my advice. Sorry about that. Different ppl find meaning in different things, but I think that even if some of this advice is faulty in your case, it definitely has value. \n\nGood luck my friend. You\u2019ll find your way. Peace love \u270c\ufe0f. \n\nTL;DR - Put yourself out there, get rejected ignored ridiculed and excluded, and naturally find the people who accept and want you.",

Our communities and groups often define us and shape our individual worlds. Community can refer to various aspects, including shared geography, religion, race/ethnicity, income, ideology, and more. Please choose one of your communities or groups and describe its significance. Explain how, as a product of this community or group, you would enrich our campus.\\*\n\nI want to know if it would make sense to talk about the car community. A big part of my application is cars, I do car photography, have a car spotting social media page, and have started my car show organization. My common app essay is also on cars.\n\nUMass Amherst has a car club so I would contribute to it during my time at UMass. Thats why I think it would make sense.\n\nBut Im here to ask if it would be better to just talk about my racial/religious background and kinda BS.",

All of these schools generally want well-rounded students and you said that you have already addressed your involvement in the car community elsewhere in the app. If they\u2019re reading the supplemental, they\u2019re probably still looking for a reason to admit you so take the opportunity that the supplemental provides to give them one. \nGood Luck!",

Our communities and groups often define us and shape our individual worlds. Community can refer to various aspects, including shared geography, religion, race/ethnicity, income, ideology, and more. Please choose one of your communities or groups and describe its significance. Explain how, as a product of this community or group, you would enrich our campus.\\*\n\nI want to know if it would make sense to talk about the car community. A big part of my application is cars, I do car photography, have a car spotting social media page, and have started my car show organization. My common app essay is also on cars.\n\nUMass Amherst has a car club so I would contribute to it during my time at UMass. Thats why I think it would make sense.\n\nBut Im here to ask if it would be better to just talk about my racial/religious background and kinda BS.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is only put into the award section of your financial aid as part of your estimated contribution.  What happens if you don't get a work study job is that you have to come up with that money for your expenses another way.  That could be an additional loan, spending less on things, or a job not covered by work study such as off campus.",

At some point I mentioned that being done in the past, and the staff persons I was working with that handled student hiring paperwork told me they no longer did that.  One of them had also worked in the financial aid office before that.\n\nAs for \"spending less\", the estimated cost of attendance figures include a certain amount of personal expenses such as travel or snacks outside meal plans, and money for textbooks.  So traveling less often or using cheaper methods of travel is one way of spending less.  For textbooks, check with the instructor's syllabus to see if you actually need a text, see about finding a used copy if you do.  There are texts for some of the courses on reserve at the library.  Using those may be enough depending on the course.\n\nFor housing costs the estimate is based on a standard shared dorm room.  Plus a small amount extra is included that some use for break housing or whatever.  There are lower cost options available, especially after your freshman year when you can live off campus.  The default meal plan includes $250 dollars only spendable at food locations on campus, not everyone uses that money.  So you can save a bit there as well.  And if you move off campus and make a good portion of your meals you can save even more.\n\nBut basically look at any expense and see if there is a way to save a bit.  Some will depend on which major you are in and courses you take, but other savings will come from looking over what you need to spend and what is optional.",

I don't recall if they had an option to stay over Winter Break.  Back then I just had to request to stay and be approved.  They would have me sign out a different key for the entrance doors, they actually changed the locks for the breaks.\n\nIt ended sometime later.  From what I heard through the staff grapevine, a group of students in one dorm stayed over a break and threw a big party.  The place was trashed when they were done.  A policy that everyone had to move out for the breaks was in place for quite a while.  They started adding break housing about 20 years ago when they got the state legislature to remove the 15% cap on out-of-state students as part of UMass getting greater fiscal autonomy.  Out-of-state students are now nearly 30%, and they had to provide some option for those who couldn't travel home for breaks.  They also added a break housing fee, formerly $300 a semester, now $400.",

If you ask for cameras in the halls near the bathrooms they will claim it\u2019s a privacy issue for individuals who have rooms nearby. If you ask for better stalls and more safety precautions in the bathrooms they will ignore it and site funding issues. Please also note that your ARD/RD of your building will likely agree and sympathize with you in this being an issue 1000%, however, they have no control over this. During my time as an RA I had plenty of women feel unsafe due to the amount of men using the restrooms to shower and everything in between because they were too lazy to go to another floor to their assigned bathroom. I was threatened by own residents to take action but unfortunately it was out of my hands. All I was authorized to do was send out an email pleading men on my floor to use the right bathroom. The \u201chigher-powers\u201d of this university will try to brush this off and they will refuse to take action. But don\u2019t stop advocating for your safety.

I was wondering if there is any preventative measures that can be put in place? Perhaps a camera outside the bathrooms in the hallways? Where would I even go to start raising this issue? From what I heard, this has also happened in 2014 as well. It seems like there is nothing in place to prevent further incidents like this. This is a serious issue against the privacy of all students here. I feel strongly about this topic as it will help prevent this from happening to futher stufents. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

All offices at UMass Amherst will be closed the following Monday through Wednesday for 2 closure days and New Years.  So the earliest a transcript will be seen by admissions staff is the 2nd.  In the past they have had the transfer deposit for Spring admission due by the middle of December.\n\nSo they may admit you based on your existing record - HS, SAT, and possibly mid-term grades - but with the admission contingent on your transcript.  There may be some later deadlines I am not aware of, but there is not going to be a lot of time available to sign up for orientation and registering for courses left in January.\n\nAt least applications through UMass Interchange do not have an application fee required, so applying multiple times will not cost you extra.  You also have not mentioned what degree program you want to take, do read the notes about those that have special requirements for the selective majors.",

Always just go for it, fall is definitely much better if you keep good grades this year and the transfer process will be easier. there's a higher transfer acceptance rate for fall. My advice, email your transfer counselor frequently. Ask them all kinds of questions, demonstrate that you're interested in the school, talk to them about your growth and ask them how to go about the application process. I was waitlisted for fall 2024 (senior year of hs) and i got in for the spring with no college coursework to show, all I did was pester the admissions people and try my hardest. you can also apply with  first choice and second choice major, if your first choice is too competitive you have a chance at being admitted under your second.",

The scooter was coming in perpendicular to my right side, so it was only at the end of the crosswalk where they passed me. Obviously I looked both ways before crossing, but wasn't intending to have a scooter pass through when there were tons of people walking and there was only a narrow opening for them to pass because the car  on their left was taking up a lot of room.",

It's accessible via the \"frequently asked questions\" tab, which doesn't really make any sense to me, and I feel that a forum like piazza would make things easier for everyone involved. The forms are not really a substitute for email, however, as they state the questions will be answered in a supplementary video posted after the assignment you're asking questions about is due. Also worth noting that I can no longer see his office hours listed, only the TAs', and I believe there was like one hour per week when I first looked.",

You will do better in courses that you like. It's OK to explore and discover a new field/major that you actually like. That's (part of) what college is for.",

The bus takes 5 hours since that route has transfers at Springfield and Hartford before going to Boston.\n\nGood luck finding an Uber, most drivers in this area will not take a trip to Boston as there is an almost zero chance of getting a return rider.\n\nI would have suggested Amtrak, but until the end of October the Lake Shore limited is not running between Albany and Boston.  They are providing alternate bus transport instead out of Springfield which would arrive too late.  The alternate routes through New Haven also are out.\n\nBasically your travel date is on a day with poor service from the usual public transit operators.",

The cheaper travel methods to the airports would require going the day or evening before and making some arrangement to stay overnight.\n\nAs an example, Valley Transporter to Bradley will cost you $78 plus gratuity for a shared ride from Amherst.  The cost to Logan is $325 on their site, that includes the gratuity.  But they will pick you up and get you there in the early morning.\n\nCompared to that, Peter Pan to Hartford and then the Bradley Flyer shuttle will cost you about $22, to Logan about $40.  The exact price may vary, Peter Pan does use demand responsive pricing.  However your flight would either need to be later in the morning or afternoon at least.

Bradley is nearly an hour drive.  Depending on time of day they might have a good chance of picking up a passenger there, but otherwise they are outside their normal area.  So making the choice between 2 or 3 pickups during the same time period, Bradley loses out.\n\nWithin the last few weeks some have asked about Uber to Logan.  One person who has driven for Uber posted that trips over 45 minutes are now flagged differently.  Another posted that they saw an $85 price posted on Uber for that kind of trip.  So someone taking that has committed themselves to 4 hours going to Logan and back, no certainty of a return passenger, and using maybe $20 of gas plus tolls.  I haven't seen a price posted for Amherst to Bradley, but if the payout is anything like to Logan, not an attractive one money wise.",

As far as dress, it is ok for you to dress \"nice\" in normal college wear -- no objectionable tee-shirts, etc. Yes, bring your resume. I'd say that making eye contact and smiling and being personable is also important -- you are making a first impression with someone who might be your work colleague in the future.\n\nIf you are anxious at all, practice a having a conversation with your friend ahead of time, asking them to play the part of someone collecting resumes for a position that it is their job to help hire for. The person recruiting might quickly scan your resume and ask you a question about your experience or might ask you why you are interested in the position. \n\nI'd definitely encourage you to go. Having had the experience of going to career fair/recruiting events now will give you confidence with your job search efforts going forward.\n\nBest of luck!",

There was a point where there wasn\u2019t enough housing for transfers, so they placed some of them into an off campus hotel, but that occurred a few years ago.

I lived in a 2 bedroom apartment with 4 other ppl (5 of us total) and my rent was only about $550 a month with utilities, which equates to about $2.2k a semester, about half the cost of a normally priced double room on campus. Sure, I had to give up a nice spacious room, but that\u2019s some luxury you have to give up if you really want to save money and not be paying back loans the rest of your life. Find a job to help supplement any extra additional costs, maybe even two jobs if you can handle it.",

You just have to start looking at a reasonable time ahead and not leave it until late in the Spring semester.  It will also take looking for potential roommates to live off campus, it is less expensive to room with others.  They calculate your estimated cost of attending pretty much the same whether you live on campus or off.\n\nOne way students living off campus save is by not needing to buy one of the residential meal plans.  You can save quite a bit if you prepare many of your own meals  as compared to paying $3500+ a semester.",

Once you know how to write a good formal analysis you'll be good lol.\n\n I'm shocked that you were able to take a 300 course as a freshman haha . They aren't easy but they're manageable !

The goal of the experiment was to examine how different temperature settings in dorm rooms impacted energy consumption and student behavior.\n\nSome students reported discomfort as their dorms were kept at varying temperatures without their prior consent. The research was meant to gather data on energy efficiency, but it raised ethical concerns about consent and student well-being at the time.\n\nWhile this wasn't classified as a dangerous experiment, it did involve manipulation of environmental conditions that affected students, and it later fueled debates around ethics in university-led research.\u00a0",

This also leaves from Haigis Mall.  The B79 route operates 5 days a week, no Tuesday or Wednesday service.  There are 3 trips a day except on Sundays with just 2.\n\nTake the B43 bus to Northampton and you can take either Greyhound or Amtrak.  Greyhound is just one trip a day the last time I checked.

As I think I said at the time, I am not aware of the mechanism by which that award happened.  What I have seen is OOS students consistently being awarded between $12k-$16k which is why I'd say, as a rule, don't expect more.  And as I said in my previous post, there may be some university-specific grants that may be awarded\u00a0but you can't count on any more than the typical merit aid amount.\n\nHowever even with the amount of aid you mentioned your friend received, the cost of attendance for an out of state student is still close to $60k which left your friend (I imagine) with close to $40k to pay to attend. \n\nAgain, I can't emphasize this enough, the role that OOS students play in any state college system is typically to be cash cows to support the state university's ability to admit and educate more in-state students. UCs, for example, are almost $80k a year for OOS and most of them offer 0 financial aid to OOS.  The best place to look for the most amount of aid plus the lower in-state tuition rate is within your state, at your state universities.",

The merit based aid is entirely dependent on high school grades, not all out-of-state applicants get it or get the full amount.  Those who do get awarded the merit based aid usually get between $12-16K.  There are well off students from out of state whose grades are on the lower side.  They do end up attending without merit aid because they and their families go for the lower cost compared to private schools.\n\nOn the needs based aid side, that is based on FAFSA.  The resources are mostly limited to Federal funded grants and loan programs.  There are some grants funded by UMass institutional funds available to out-of-state students as well as in-state.  But the in-state students do have an advantage as there are also other state funded aid programs available to them.  I have known a few out-of-state students who got a significant amount of needs based aid, but not all get as much.\n\nWhere out-of-state students really lose out on aid is for transfers.  The merit aid grants for incoming freshmen are not awarded to transfers.",

Big group of friends that lived on floors 3-6 (one of those was a communal hall) and did nearly everything together.  Great times.  I\"m really glad my son is looking at the school ;  i'm trying not to influence him, but it would make me so happy if he organically chose it as the right school for him.

There was a period of time when I depended on some of these places for food when I worked evenings and hadn't brought my own dinner from home.\n\nSomeone I knew from my student days was an assistant manager at D P Dough, so I got to hear about the closing and reasons behind it.  Haven't had a chance to try it under the new franchise that returned them to where they started out over 35 years ago.\n\nPinocchio\u2019s closed in Amherst after a 2005 fire in the building where they were located.  The space under them was being renovated for a tanning salon, someone had turned off the sprinkler system, and it burned up through the floor and heavily smoke damaged Pinocchio\u2019s.  The owner did start up a new location in Three Rivers, but was still dealing with the insurance companies years later for reimbursements.  Never did reopen in Amherst.\n\nThe Sub became The Sub and Pizza under a new owner at some point about 20 years ago.  If I recall correctly, they closed when their landlord didn't renew the lease.  That was so The Spoke next door in the building could expand into their space.  I miss them, I had been buying subs there for years, including in the early '80s when people still knew it had originally been opened as a Subway.  The owner then exited his franchise agreement over a dispute with Subway.  They tried to go after him for violations of the agreement and too similar a name and lost in court.  Only thing they won on was that he was ordered to remove any Subway decor, but that was a moot point because those had already been removed.  One of the disputes had been that he requested permission to sell soups along with the subs, and they denied that.  Years later Subway added soups to their menu.",

I'm a current senior in HS and looking to apply to UMass, and am deciding between my first and second choice majors to put on my common app application. Informatics or Business: Operations & Information Management? I want to go into consulting or a similar industry in the future... what do you guys suggest? I'm also an international student and am hoping to get a STEM OPT extension. Thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The table isn't big.\n\nI left my seat to go get something, and come back and there's someone else's belongings on the table I am sitting at. Mind you, there were plenty of unoccupied seats/tables in the dining hall common at the time I went. I was confused because I had a personal belonging on a chair and the table had some of my tableware on it, so I would've thought that would be a clear indication that it was occupied.\n\nI then move the person's items to the edge of the table because I didn't know what to do. This person then comes back and sits down and starts gobbling their food in a very odd manner, making noises and eating quickly. Then, they left after 30 seconds to put their dish away. I looked at this person in the eyes for a good 5 seconds, perplexed, but they made no eye contact and just looked at phone. I then just left.\n\nIf the person came and asked me if they could sit there or if they initiated a conversation with intentions of trying to make a friend, I would have been more than welcome to stay and get to know them. But, that wasn't the case. What would you all have done in this situation?\n\n  \nEDIT: I'm done replying to comments because people have no reading comprehension.

I wouldn\u2019t mind someone just grabbing the other half without saying anything if it\u2019s busy either, though it would be a bit odd.\n\nWhat this person is describing is someone deliberately sitting at an occupied table during a non-busy time, not saying anything, then leaving immediately.

The table isn't big.\n\n\n\nI left my seat to go get something, and come back and there's someone else's belongings on the table I am sitting at. Mind you, there were plenty of unoccupied seats/tables in the dining hall common at the time I went. I was confused because I had a personal belonging on a chair and the table had some of my tableware on it, so I would've thought that would be a clear indication that it was occupied. \n\nI then move the person's items to the edge of the table because I didn't know what to do. This person then comes back and sits down and starts gobbling their food in a very odd manner, making noises and eating quickly. Then, they leaves after 30 seconds to put his dish away. I looked at this person in the eyes for a good 5 seconds, perplexed, but they made no eye contact and just looked at phone. I then just left.\n\nIf the person came and asked me if they could sit there or if they initiated a conversation with intentions of trying to make a friend, I would have been more than welcome to stay and get to know them. But, that wasn't the case. What would you all have done in this situation? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Nobody cares about the age as long as you're not signing them in at dorm security. You'll be fine. yes no one will know about how many nights if you're not signing them in so you're good there's also other ways around that. Family night work worse case use a guest swipe. Or have someone else guest swipe them if they can. \n\nYou'll be fine basically just have to avoid dorm security  good luck",

We had overnight guests stay much longer than the official dorm policy. \n\nFor minors supervisors would fill out a form for liability reasons in case anything went wrong. I honestly don't remember if a parent *needs* to be present but if they're there the first night it would make the process a lot easier. There were underage siblings that would spend the night routinely and I filled out the forms often. If a parent isn't there they might ask to call a parent for permission. After the form is filled out the first night- it makes it easier for future nights. Tell the supervisor in advance that they are spending multiple nights. \n\nFor dining halls just tell the person she's your sister and they'll wave her through. \n\nHope this helps.",

You can double check with the Bursars, but I think there are no other fees for regular attendance that you still have to pay.  If you remained in the area and wanted to use the recreational facilities, that would be a separate fee.  It is included in regular tuition and fees, but not UWW tuition and fees.\n\nIf you were looking at this form on the Registrars site - https://www.umass.edu/registrar/sites/default/files/SeniorYearinAbsentia.pdf, that should be the most recent version.  It doesn't mention a difference in getting credits approved between UWW and other schools.  So you will still need approvals from your dept., dean, etc.\n\nI haven't seen a limit on number of semesters, but you should ask your dean or academic advisor.  You do need to have already completed 87 or more credits before filing for senior year in absentia.\n\nOne final thing to check on if you are getting financial aid is how this will affect it.  That you will have to talk about with someone at the financial aid department.",

Undergrad students do not pay FICA (SS & Medicare) during the school year when they are enrolled in classes.  However during the Summer undergrads who are not enrolled in at least 6 credits do have to pay FICA.  Those who are taking courses meeting that credit requirement can file an exemption form.\n\nIn the past the university would enroll students in an alternate retirement fund instead of SS, I do not see that option mentioned.  I mostly had undergrad student employees, so not sure if grads fall under the same rules for FICA during the semesters and Summer.",

(section on FICA exemption near the bottom) I had seen that the exemption applied for students who had work study jobs during the school year, but it looks like it\u2019s for any student who is enrolled in at least 6 credits and is employed *on campus*.\n\nI assume that if you are not paying FICA the work doesn\u2019t earn SS credits, but for most people I guess this won\u2019t be an issue anyway.",

Best I could find was the exemption form for students enrolled in Summer '24 classes.\n\nThat usually is not a problem about FICA, the number of quarters required is usually met outside of school years.  But personally if I had been paying into FICA while a student it would have made a difference.  In my case I did not accumulate enough quarters, but as I will collect on the state pension I paid into it does not matter.",

Only total cunts having a bad day who work a job like that actually care if you walk away with a cup of coffee they know is completely watered down.

The ILC, the market across from bluewall, newman center (if that's still a thing?), the cafe across from the market in blue wall.\n\nYou got options.

Most of the time it will not, living expenses such as room & board are included in the estimated cost of attendance whether you live on or off campus.  There are a very few strange scholarships limited to paying for on campus living, but those very few students receive.\n\nBasically you can live off campus and plan on spending $1000 or a bit less per person a month in rent.  Main extra expense is that will be for 12 months a year, but it is comparable to what you pay in the dorms.  If you prepare a good portion of your own meals you can save compared to being on a meal plan.  If you stay in the area you would be able to work more than 20 hours a week during the Summer.\n\nI would suggest looking for places in Sunderland near the bus route.  Rents there are a bit lower than in Amherst itself.  The buses run frequently enough to get you to and from campus, and are fare free all year.  If you got a place in Hadley the buses charge fares during the Summer.  Unless you and your partner can put together a group, renting an apartment will probably make more sense than trying to rent a house.",

        "text": "The monkey lab is real, and it is on campus. And they don't torture their animals.\n\nPETA really irritates me, so I figured as someone who has inside information as an AnSci major I'd share what the monkey lab actually is.\n\nThe Lacreuse Lab uses marmosets as a model species to study cognitive decline with age, and sex differences in aging. I have met Dr. Lacreuse and she clearly cares deeply about both her research and her lab's animals.\n\nEverything PETA says about her lab is a lie. They do not implant devices into the marmosets' brains. They do not induce hot flashes in the marmosets. And they do not kill the marmosets to dissect their brains (that would completely defeat the purpose of studying them aging).\n\nThe Lacreuse Lab meets all federal and University standards for animal care, and like all facilities on campus that house animals they are regularly officially inspected.\n\nWhen Dr. Lacreuse spoke about her research, she talked about giving the marmosets marshmallows as a treat to reward good behavior, and having them play games on a giant iPad-like device to test their memory. This woman is not abusing monkeys.\n\nSome people believe that animals should not be used for research, and that is a completely valid opinion. Unfortunately, science and technology are not yet advanced enough to eliminate the need for animals in research. It's okay to dislike the use of animal models or morally disagree with it, but what's not okay is PETA constantly verbally attacking and slandering Dr. Lacreuse.\n\nPETA has taken their campaign very far this semester with their stickers and posters and graffiti, and it pisses me off that they so insistently campaign against a law-abiding lab when there are so many real, actual cases of animal abuse they could be focusing on instead.\n\nYou can read about the Lacreuse lab and their research here: https://www.lacreuselab.com/\n\nTLDR: Yes the monkey lab is real, no the monkeys are not being tortured. PETA sucks.\n\n\nEdit because some people can't think critically: I am not saying that research using animal models is all sunshine and rainbows. Lab animals provide an invaluable service that we should all be grateful for. They experience stress and discomfort, but their suffering is minimized by the laws that protect them. If you want to learn more, Google the 3 R's of using animals in research.",

That doesn't mean all farming is bad and evil. Once again, take an ANSCI class if you really are so interested in learning about agriculture and human use of animals.\n\nAlso classic PETA move of you, shoving gore in people's faces to scare them.

I have met Dr. Lacreuse and she clearly cares deeply about both her research and her lab's animals.\n\nEverything PETA says about her lab is a lie. They do not implant devices into the marmosets' brains. They do not induce hot flashes in the marmosets. And they do not kill the marmosets to dissect their brains (that would completely defeat the purpose of studying them aging).\n\nThe Lacreuse Lab meets all federal and University standards for animal care, and like all facilities on campus that house animals they are regularly officially inspected.\n\nWhen Dr. Lacreuse spoke about her research, she talked about giving the marmosets marshmallows as a treat to reward good behavior, and having them play games on a giant iPad-like device to test their memory. This woman is not abusing monkeys.\n\nSome people believe that animals should not be used for research, and that is a completely valid opinion. Unfortunately, science and technology are not yet advanced enough to eliminate the need for animals in research. It's okay to dislike the use of animal models or morally disagree with it, but what's not okay is PETA constantly verbally attacking and slandering Dr. Lacreuse.\n\nPETA has taken their campaign very far this semester with their stickers and posters and graffiti, and it pisses me off that they so insistently campaign against a law-abiding lab when there are so many real, actual cases of animal abuse they could be focusing on instead.\n\nYou can read about the Lacreuse lab and their research here: https://www.lacreuselab.com/\n\nTLDR: Yes the monkey lab is real, no the monkeys are not being tortured. PETA sucks.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/umass) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

(2019) was used to assess whether Letrozole affected hippocampal gene expression and evaluate sex differences in differential expression\n(Fig. 1). Treatment groups were matched based on age and sex, with\nanimals receiving 20 \u03bcg of either Letrozole mixed in pudding or pudding without the drug. These animals were part of a previous study (Gervais et al., 2019) that measured behavior, memory and thermoregulation as well as CA1 hippocampal physiology to evaluate if Letrozole's negative side effects reported in cisgender women could be recapitulated in common marmosets. All animals were gonadectomized approximately 3 years before the experiment began which prevented socially housed animals from breeding or undergoing ovulatory cycles. Our previous study measured peripheral levels of estradiol in both control and Letrozole-treated animals and found low circulating levels of estradiol in the urine of control animals and nearly no estradiol in the urine of Letrozole-treated animals (Gervais et al., 2019). The animals were cared for and humanely euthanized in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and University of Massachusetts Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee\"\n\nThe entire paragraph was taken in full context so there is no bias from me or PETA. I agree that PETA shouldn't be harassing Dr. Lacreuse or anyone in the lab. However, all your claims about PETA lying are actually lies from you. You haven't issued a correction for any of those despite me providing you information directly obtained from Dr. Lacreuse herself. Furthermore, you also got the mods to pin your misinformation post.",

I will condone sending emails, making phone calls, legal forms of peaceful protest, and many things people who don't want to be bothered consider to be harassment.  \n\nAs for the 'propaganda' - If this is a legitimate complaint that PETA has, you're fine that they have it as long as you're not personally subjected to looking at it? That would be kind of gross. If there is an actual problem here, wouldn't you want someone putting pressure on the organization and to expose the public to the possibility that things are happening behind closed doors in a way that is not kosher? \n\nIt kind of sounds like you just hate PETA and think that absolutely everything they do is some kind of fabrication, which is clearly untrue as history shows. They absolutely have exposed labs and many other organizations for illegal practices. They are not a perfect organization, far from it, but not \\*everything\\* they produce is fabrication.

Don\u2019t know if interested in 1 on 1 online guitar lessons but I give hour long lessons for only $40, and right now I\u2019m running a discount on the first month, leaving them at $30 each.\n\nIn these lessons we\u2019ll focus on the student\u2019s interests, like technique, improvising, composing, arranging, ear training or music theory, and also how to build structured practice routines and update them weekly to keep them fresh. These lessons are aimed at every level, from beginner to advanced.\n\nI graduated from music school and have been playing as a session player and teaching guitar for 6 years now.

I'm not sure about on-campus, but Amethyst Gems on North Pleasant Street (next to Coronation Cafe and across from Miss Saigon) has cute jewelry. It will be more gems and charms style than cheap/plastic, though. I always thought their jewelry is cute. Sometimes there are street vendors along North Pleasant Street and on the town commons, too. Hope that helps!",

Help lobby for nuclear energy. Have fewer things shipped to you. Switch to eating poultry. That sort of thing. Ignore that other sanctimonious asshole OP.\n\nNow, like one of the other commenters mentioned there's some cute jewelry stores in town, as well as some in Northampton that would have what you're looking for. I'd even recommend getting embroidery thread and making bracelets, that can be done easily, cheaply, and with minimal environmental impact as long as you're using non-synthetic fibres.",

                "text": "No longer a student but had similar issues when I was, especially being an extremely shy introvert. General options and tips, as usual:\n\n1. Find people with similar interests, usually through an activity group or organization. But also be open to trying new things. Never been hiking? Go do it with a group and see if it works out.\n\n2. Don't be afraid to talk to strangers, whether in a dining hall or student group. I know it's extremely uncomfortable, awkward, and difficult, but it's something you gotta practice (and quite frankly how lots of adult friendships begin. Sorry no one in grade school prepared you for this).\n\n Find someone who seems like they can use a friend, or any group of people who seem friendly / might have similar interests. And you can be honest about needing friends/socialization or needing to practice social skills. There are lots of people struggling with this, and many will empathize. \n\n3. Practice small talk. I know it's fucking cringe talking about the weather or the fact you don't have plans for the weekend, but the purpose of small talk is to begin building those socialization bridges and finding commonality with people. \n\nIntroverts, it's okay to talk about yourself.\n\nYou're looking forward to clear weather and 70 degrees? Sidetrack and talk about how you miss gardening at home, or how you'd like to go kayaking.\nSomeone complaining about the rain? Tell em you love the rain, how it leads to things you like like a quiet home, and how you'd like to just read whatever novel, or like that time you were at Six Flags and a thunderstorm occurred for 15 minutes and emptied out the park, leaving all rollercoasters to be walk-on rides.\n\nBut also, don't forget to be curious about the other person and ask them questions about their interests, plans...etc.\n\n4. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Not every conversation leads to some magical lifelong friendship. It takes practice, but it also takes luck \ud83e\udd37 that's life. \n\n5. Once again, very few people tell you this when you're young, but friendships take a completely different dynamic post grade school. Friendships are fleeting; they come and go. Sometimes they last years or even decades, and some only last a few months. Sometimes you only see each other once a week, once a month....once every few years. Some of this applies to family relationships as well (I know, sad). So cherish these moments and really live in them when they happen. \n\n6. Give yourself a break. Don't have too much expectations and certainly don't over exert yourself trying to make friends. College / work are exhausting enough. \n\nI know UMass is a VERY socially charged environment, especially on weekend nights, and you might feel pressured to get out there as a result. It's okay to spend time recharging / not being social if you're tired AF. You don't HAVE to socialize if you don't want to. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with you if you're not in the mood to be socializing on Friday night, or if you're alone in your dorm room while others are out partying, or if you don't have plans for the weekend. I'm 29 and spend most of my weekend nights writing/producing EDM in my bedroom, waking up early to hike with my dog, and I am NOT sorry for missing out on partying / bars.\n\nLife isn't a race. We don't all make friends / money at the same pace. Be you. Enjoy the moment (but also, don't forget to practice socializing!).",

Worth checking out if you're even a little musically inclined.\n\nIn general any club is a good idea for making friends tho if you're not super into the band idea. I was in an RSO and made some good friends. You just have to put yourself out there, which is difficult (I have social anxiety disorder trust me I know how hard it can be).",

                "text": "I found UMass an alienating place in many ways when I was there (over a decade ago now). Completely feel your pain. First, I really recommend reading and internalizing what u/xen05zman said in their comment. \n\nBuilding off of those recommendations, I cannot stress enough that not everyone you make small talk with/start hanging out with has to be your friend. They can just be acquaintances. But acquaintances, crucially, can plug you into a larger social network. Not everyone is going to be that friend from elementary school whose house you went over to every day - and that's something I had to learn. But you will eventually find someone you click with on that level if you keep exploring. UMass is *huge*.\n\nThe other thing I'd recommend, and I know it's not exactly the same as it once was, is looking at clubs like *The Daily Collegian*. Ever thought about writing about the news? Movies? Politics? Art? Theater? Pop over to their orientation meetings and see what they have to say. No experience necessary! It took me until my final year to do that and I fell absolutely in love. I was so mad I hadn't gone years earlier. Would have transformed my undergrad experience.\n\nIf not *The Daily Collegian*, find a similar club and see what it's all about. The easiest way to meet people you'll like is to do activities, just as /u/xen05zman said. I just recommended that particular club because I always found the vibes to be excellent, and because a newspaper covers so many topics you inevitably can find a subject area that appeals to you.\n\nFinally, I want to stress you're not alone. Loads of students (across the Five Colleges) are sitting in their dorms feeling the same way you are. Problem is none of y'all are meeting up! I learned this when I started using dating apps and learned there were loads of people like me (i.e. folks not interested in meeting at parties or clubs).\n\nKeep at it!",

If you are looking for somewhere quiet and nice to study I would definitely reccomend South College, although you may get some looks if you are super noisy or on the phone. Additionally, the library is always an option and from my experience people are louder there than in South College (for not being a library it sure feels like one). Specifically for group work I recommend either the basement or floors 9 or 21 as those all have group spaces. You can also reserve group study rooms in both library\u2019s (WEB and SEL). You could also look into the basement of Bartlett hall, which is closer to southwest. I believe there are small study rooms you could maybe take phone calls in, but I don\u2019t know what the use policy is. I try to avoid that building as it is old and feels like a crime scene could happen at any minute. Lastly, your major likely has a specific common area type thing that you could look into.",

When it was built and opened the administration talked about it supplementing the other gyms on campus.  But since then Totman has been mostly given over to the Kinesiology dept., and more of Boyden (the one by SW) including its weight room has been restricted to varsity athletics.  The pool in Totman has been closed as well.\n\nOne of the campus master plans included an expansion of the Rec Center on its north end.  I have no idea when the administration will have the money and the will to go forward with that plan.\n\nOh, and they have taken space from the existing gyms for varsity sports on top of building a few new training facilities for those athletes as well.",

I would say that, if you in fact think you\u2019re surrounded by people who don\u2019t recognize your awesomeness (because you are awesome for going to UMass), you should 100% believe in yourself and like yourself and your goals. Go the gym. Eat alone. Speak up in class. If you do that, the right people will gravitate towards you and you won\u2019t even have to worry about needing to find them. Im class of \u201809 so not sure how much has changed. I\u2019m actually visiting very shortly so I\u2019m curious to see what the vibe is like. UMass can be awesome. Don\u2019t let go of that vision.\n\nAlso, chatting people up before class I remember being a great way to make friends. Man I miss college.\n\nAlso I should note that being class of \u201809 meant that it really was pre social media. Facebook was just gaining traction but none of us had smart phones.

(reached out to the prof and she said there isn't any and i should reach out to the academic dean)\n\nalso as a side question, if everyone is shelling thousands of dollars every year on these platforms, why doesn't the math department just hire a bunch of cs students on campus to make its own platform for way cheaper? \n\n\nedit: I was exaggerating with i literally cannot afford it. I mean I can if i stretch my budget to the extreme, but this is not it. Paying to do your own homework yourself should not be a model companies should be built on or colleges should be promoting. I'll cough up the money for now, but like as the consumers of educational industry we need reform ig? sorry if thats too revolutionary. ",

It's a bummer that that is the case and that you were unaware of that, but it's the reality and is generally common knowledge. Looks like according to the stats the average student spends 600-1200 dollars a year on textbooks and homework technologies. No, the platforms won't discount it, and no UMass won't build their own either, because most of these products are specifically tied to a textbook which the platforms own or work with. It's a way for these textbook companies to still make lots of money even if you pirate the pdf of your book.

It's free for professors and is great in coming up with a whole bunch of questions. \n\nThink of why Texas Instruments has such a stronghold in the US.\n\nGradescope will remain free. Most of the costs are gonna be textbooks & these platforms in the Math department. Not much you can do, it's actually up to the higher ups in the deparrtment and not the prof themself.\n\nTake Stat 515, for example. There are like 5-7 sections of that class every semester. Each section is taught independently, but share the same exam (at least the final) and the homework. Thus, while the professor can accomodate to any lengths in your section, accomodating for Cengage is dependent on the higher ups making the sections. \n\nPearson is worse, and you'll soon realize why once you start using it.",

They are annoying but the thing is that if there's one, there's a nest of them somewhere else. Keep ur room clean, sweep the floors weekly and throw out your trash as well. They will appear for a single crumb of food and you don't want to attract them. I say if you see more than 3 in ur room like this month; very possible the nest is somewhere close. I eat in my room but I never eat on the bed because I'm not risking dropping crumbs which are just common to have when eating chips and stuff. And then like others say, there are bug sprays and traps. Definitely bug spray but obviously don't stay in the room when you do it. Go to class or eat for a few hours",

The biggest differences i\u2019ve noticed while attending is the student body and its culture (which is also largely dependent on location). So if location, price or culture is what you want changed- then yes look into other schools. \n\nSurprisingly UMASS has the easiest class registration system i\u2019ve used and also has the best autonomy i\u2019ve experienced as a student.\n\nAdvice: the grass isn\u2019t always greener. Focus hard on your undergrad especially if it\u2019s in-state tuition and work on strong grad applications.",

It\u2019s good to be social, but a 3 hour window of nothing is pretty hard to fill (unless you\u2019ve got some classwork to do). Since you\u2019re a freshman, though, a cool thing to do is look at all the locations on the map and go to them. There\u2019s greenhouses and gyms and like a million places to explore (although there\u2019s only so many, at some point u will get to them all lol). Pro tip- the apiary does not seem to exist anymore. Skip that one lol.

You\u2019ll see familiar faces around the building, you might also see familiar faces at the dining hall, especially in the first couple of weeks, just sit down and talk to people, after asking if you could join them. Most people will welcome that and almost no one will be a sociopath who tells you to get lost.\n\nThe second type of success I had was based on common interest. So you can do that through clubs or different groups that you see advertised around it by flying or something else. For me, I was really into hardcore/metal music and would just go up and talk to people that I would see in band shirts or things that I knew right off the bat we had some sort of common interest. Maybe it\u2019s going to the gym or playing board games or something like that.\n\nYou can also get a job on campus and meet people that way, or see if you can do something with the newspaper or the radio station/TV production if those are important to you. \n\nRemember mostly everyone wants to feel connected to the people around them. Give it time, and you\u2019ll find your people.",

You get college credits for passing with a certain score, every test and school is different so find out.

I was able to get 12 credits from taking a couple of them which was helpful after honestly being suspended because of difficulties with my mental health.

Students who are interested in swapping can do so every Thursday or Friday from September 12 through October 25. This process is completed in SPIRE under Housing > Room Assignment Changes > Room Swap. When a student initiates a swap request, the person they intend to swap with will receive an email. Once both students have approved the swap, the assignment is automatically updated. Any students who are reassigned will have until Sunday to complete their move. Students must also properly exchange keys by going to their Residential Service Desks. Failure to exchange keys through the service desk will result in a $250 Lock Recore Fee.\n\nHere\u2019s the link to where this info is: https://www.umass.edu/living/assign/undergrad-current",

It's a town in nowhere and it'll feel even more lonely.\n\nAnd since it affected me a lot, this is for international students, if you play video games and have to use your mic, and you have an accent + speech impediment, just stop using your mic. Doesn't matter if it's a team game. The racist comments are not worth it every game. It'll fester insecurities and crush your self-esteem and make it hard for you to let our your voice and proactively socialize in uni, even itl. Make time for other stuff and don't let such comments hurt your perception of yourself. Seek out friends. Nobody hates you. Its only people hiding behind a screen who think they have the power to hide and say anything they want. Your voice is fine. These are the things I wish I could've said to myself before I ruined my extrovertedness, I'll impart it you instead. Please don't be scared of embarrassing yourself.",

I'm a freshman (18F) and I know that I'll get to know more people but it seems like everyone knows each other. Its difficult not to feel isolated. Have any of you felt way out of your depth freshman year and if so, can I get some advice?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Prices at a commercial buffet are typically $18-$22 for lunch and $22-$28 for dinner these days, so all in all I would regard UMass's costs as pretty good pricing. Remember that the dining halls are open to the public and function as a commercial restaurant as well - lowering the prices too much can (and has) cause issues with restaurant owners in downtown Amherst. I think the current prices strike a balance between being cheap enough for non-meal plan students, being pricey enough to encourage meal plan purchasing, and being not too low to get Amherst restaurant owners mad.",

Some upper-level math classes are honors-only but I've had no problem taking those classes as someone not in the college.",

I then emailed the \"actual\" UCard office(?) and was told my current card was marked as lost. Easy fix; they just marked it as found. \n\nI went to the gym this morning, but my UCard was not registered in their system. I am unsure if it is because I am under 18 (I am still a junior, though, so it is weird) or due to another bug in the system. Of course, I will not openly share my age to the staff and immediately disqualify myself from going to the gym if I still have a chance at getting in. \n\nDoes anyone know what might be going on? I need to be able to access the gym to follow my program, as I'm training for an ultra OCR, and I really would prefer not to pay additional fees to go to a local gym. \n\nThanks!",

I went to the UCard office and was told there was nothing wrong with it. I then emailed the \"actual\" UCard office(?) and was told my current card was marked as lost. Easy fix; they just marked it as found. \n\nI went to the gym this morning, but my UCard was not registered in their system. I am unsure if it is because I am under 18 (I am still a junior, though, so it is weird) or due to another bug in the system. Of course, I will not openly share my age to the staff and immediately disqualify myself from going to the gym if I still have a chance at getting in. \n\nDoes anyone know what might be going on? I need to be able to access the gym to follow my program, as I'm training for an ultra OCR, and I really would prefer not to pay additional fees to go to a local gym. \n\nThanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm mainly looking at JFK or Logan. I've heard about the amtrak and peter pan. And Uber works as well I guess. But no idea how its gonna work (if I would have to take a bus to the amtrak station for eg. fare's gonna add on) and if its the cheapest I can get.  \nHow do international students get about usually? Any advice is welcome :)",

                "text": "IPO has this page about getting to UMass - https://www.umass.edu/international-programs/international-students-scholars/getting-umass-amherst, leaving is mostly just the reverse.  As for Uber, except for getting around the area or within Boston or New York, it is not an option for traveling to those cities.  Very few drivers will take 2 or 4 hour trips with little chance of getting a return rider.\n\nI will make some comments based on the IPO info and the fact that \"best\" and \"cheapest\" rarely work together.\n\nFirst is that in most cases your best choice is probably going to be taking Peter Pan Bus.  It is not the cheapest, but they have multiple trips each day leaving UMass that will make connections to Boston or New York.  During peak days for students leaving UMass that includes express buses to Boston South Station with many continuing on to Logan.  For those that stop at South Station you can take the Silver Line to Logan.  Peter Pan usually will hold connecting buses if your bus is a bit late getting into a terminal.\n\nThe same holds for connections to New York.  I am not as familiar with NYC, but understand there are connecting methods between the bus terminal and JFK.\n\nFor flights out of Logan the Peter Pan schedule works best if you schedule a departure in the afternoon or evening.  A morning flight would require staying overnight somewhere in Boston and then getting to Logan.  The earliest bus leaves UMass at 6:55 AM and gets to Logan at about 10:45 AM.\n\nAlternatives to Peter Pan going to Boston are taking the PVTA B79 to Worcester ($9) and then taking the commuter rail to Boston (~$13).  I forget what the fare is on the Silver Line to Logan, ~$2.  This route runs 5 days a week, no service on Tue & Wed, and some trips are a passenger van instead of a bus.\n\nAmtrak you would take from Northampton or Springfield.  The B43 bus from UMass to Northampton is free for you, just show your UCard.  Same for the R29 bus to Springfield during the school year, but it only goes as far as Holyoke on weekends and takes over 1 1/2 hours on weekdays to get to Springfield.  Faster to spend the money ($9) for a Peter Pan ticket to Springfield which is about 50 minutes.\n\nOne trip a day on Amtrak is direct from Springfield to Boston, the rest go through New Haven and take around 5 hours or more.  If you are taking Amtrak to NYC, that is not as much of an issue, better connections going that direction.  Prices for Amtrak can sometimes be less than Peter Pan, but mostly the same or more.\n\nThe IPO page also lists OurBus.  That bus service appears to have dropped its schedule between UMass and Boston completely.  It has 1 or 2 trips a day scheduled some days, not all days of the week, to NYC.  Fare tends to be less than Peter Pan.\n\nThen there are shuttle services.  They are convenient with pickup at your dorm location and drop off directly at the airports.  But they are expensive.  For example Valley Transporter will charge $325 to Logan for 1-3 passengers and $650 to JFK for the same.",

So only then would they consider your previous history as a factor. I would shoot an email to one of the transfer admissions councillors to see if they could offer any advice.

I successfully transferred to UMass Engineering through MassTransfer after getting my Associates, so I can tell you that in general, UMass admissions seems willing to overlook a rocky past if your recent record is good.\n\nThe major you apply to also matters - the chances may be lower for super competitive ones like Isenberg and CS.",

It would be up to your department, college, or the registrar (depending on the course subject area) to approve any course you take that's not listed there. \n\nYou need to fill out this form before you take any classes at another school, I would get on it quickly since the semester's about to start: https://www.umass.edu/registrar/sites/default/files/PriorApprovalforTransferWork.pdf",

For that you would need a car or a friend with a car.  But for something that you would do once or twice a month what is scheduled would allow you to either go to Worcester in the morning or at noon.  Then an appointment in the afternoon should leave you time to get back in the evening.  If you have a class that ends at noon, then you would have to arrange to leave early.  For an evening event your plans would have to include an overnight stay.\n\nBut basically state funding for transit in the western counties gets not much for commuting type schedules outside the metropolitan Springfield area.  With just over 800k population for all 4 counties much of the money for commuter service goes for the east, and pretty much ends at Worcester.\n\nP.S.

The larger halls may have more than one, for example a couple of the Orchard Hill dorms specify there are kitchens on three floors.\n\nDorm or dormitory as words are evolving in usage in the US.  When I went to school they referred to the whole building, and you will still see it used that way.  Back then we referred to our dorm room as where we lived within the building.  Now many are using \"dorm\" to refer to their room itself.  So when you see \"every dorm has a kitchen\" it can be confusing, with the intended meaning of a kitchen in the entire building.",

A bit of a silly question but I\u2019m just confused about the parking permit. I have a parking permit for lot 11 and I move in the 29th. However, online it says the parking permit is effective on September 1st. Has anyone else dealt with this and know of any other parking areas that aren\u2019t extremely expensive? Or should I just wait to bring my car to campus? Thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So usually department shows audition before guild both fall and spring. That being said, the feb and or march  show for the department auditions in November or early December. Im glad to see they moved the timeline up for the last fall show to not be the last week of the semester like last fall. As someone who did guild for 1.5 years and did department stuff overlapping for a semester, until I decided to leave guild, its hard work. Both have different reputations and I agree with court that the groups overlap but some people in each group don't like each other for various reasons. Professors in the department don't take guild seriously due to past things guild had a rep for but has mostly gotten away from. \n\n2. I was friends with people who did tech, marketing, or were on build teams while acting in a department show, but usually the guild show happened after the department one. Department will make you prioritize acting or tech in their shows which is partially why people sometimes drop out of even their small roles with guild like court was talking about. \n\n3. Regarding your question on doing only 1 show for the department and/or guild some of that is addressed above. If you're acting ; then yes both guild and department have a clause in their actor contracts/audition packets that whatever you auditioned for first is what you will do. \n\n4. Tech in both department and guild always needs more people! Especially stage managers and run crews.\n\nIm assuming your a freshman or a transfer and am unsure if you're a major and/or considering a minor but being its your first semester at UMass heres some friendly alumni advice:\n\n I'd audition for department first & pick up a 110 to learn more about how tech roles work in the department (you don't need to be a major or minor to take the 1 credit class) . If you are cast you'll get credit as a 210 which is worth 3 credits and Julie Fife (an amazing woman who both tech and scheduling wise is someone you want to introduce yourself to) will get you dropped from 110 with no penalties. Guild , being a club cant give out credit so thats another factor. If not cast in department go out for guild , and still keep the 110 as you will have your crew assignment for by then and can know if the show you're getting credit for conflicts with acting. If that will conflict with acting, quite easy to get on a team and get to know people in guild work your way up the ladder to possibly direct even after 1 or 2 semesters in guild. \n\nTheres def more I can answer than this so if you want clarification or more questions let me know :)",

That is how they are required to pay for housing, state law requiring separate funds be used.  It is the same for the dining services, all costs including staffing and debt payment are required to be paid from the money charged for meal plans and other sales.  Tuition charges can not be used for either.\n\nThe actual reason they went with a partnership has nothing to do with cutting costs, the UMass system has used up all of the money the legislature authorized it to borrow by selling bonds.  All of those shiny new buildings on campus represents around a billion borrowed and used in Amherst over the last 20 years.  As of about 6-8 years ago another 2 billion was spent on the other campuses.  They actually refinanced some of the older bonds then to free up some money.\n\nThat is why the partnership deal had them also building and financing for UMass the replacement family housing which was built on the former North Village site.  UMass does own and operate that housing, and is paying off the loan from the rents charged.\n\nAs for Fieldstone apparently not enough wealthy students want to live there, last I checked they still had openings.  No sign of lowering prices.  But when they are charging over $6000 a month for a 4 bedroom apartment they can afford some vacancies.\n\nAlso you go on to say this:\n>I used to be like that until I read public financial documents and interviews about the UMass system when the new chancellor was elected.\n\nWell, the chancellor is appointed, not elected.  And you do realize not everything is in those \"public financial documents\", just carefully selected information to sell the story the UMass administration wants out there.  More than a few have gone after them with public records requests and been stonewalled.",

There is a bus transfer in Springfield.  First bus scheduled after your flight is at 2:30, next is at 6.  I am not certain you can make that, but 1 1/2 hour might be enough.  That will get you to UMass about 4:20.  The stop for Peter Pan is at Haigis Mall near the Fine Arts Center.  From what I read they will be running shuttles from there to the checkin locations and the various residential areas, but I don't recall the hours.\n\nP.S.  I have seen rumors of a shuttle bus from the airport to Springfield, but not found anything concrete.

So a ride to the Cape, would only show up as a \u201cLong Ride (45+ minutes)\u201d \n\nThat is no longer the case, as of Aug. 15th, we drivers now finally know where you\u2019re going. The good news is that you won\u2019t have drivers asking where you\u2019re going before starting the ride, a tactic frequently employed before. The bad news is that drivers will now just reject the ride request and even though there may be 7 drivers in your immediate vicinity, none will likely take the request. \n\nWe drivers avoid going to the Eastern part of the State because we will almost always be returning without a passenger, which is a considerable waste of our time and gas. \n\nWe can make more money never leaving Amherst, especially on a Thursday or Friday, when Amherst is the most lucrative place to drive in W MA.",

Almost everything ends up going through Boston.\n\nI used to have a girlfriend whose family lived on the cape, we drove the 2.5 or so hours to visit.  The alternatives then included Bonanza, a route through Providence, about 4 hours.  But Bonanza is now owned by Peter Pan, and while the route still exists they added a stop in Worcester.  That adds a bit to the time.\n\nThe only routes shown for Plymouth & Brockton now are between Boston/Logan and Hyannis or Woods Hole.\n\nOne thing I haven't investigated fully is taking the train.  From Northampton or Springfield it can be taken to New Haven, then transfer to one headed for Providence.  Could take the bus from there, depending on how the schedules align that might save a small amount of time.",

See here: https://www.umass.edu/umpd/non-resident-student-driver-form\nYou probably don't legally qualify as a MA resident if that's the case anyway. Many of my friends at UMass kept their out of state license plates with no issues (CT, NY, NC, etc).\n\n2. If for some reason you are in a situation where you NEED to register in MA, you will require a MA-based insurance company as they need to stamp the RTA form required to register. Note that this may also require you to change your driver's license to MA as well, which you may not want to do? I would reconsider your situation.\n\n3. Car being financed is fine, you just need to get the correct info that the forms ask for (stuff like lienholder's name and address). My bf went through this process transferring his NC license to MA with a financed vehicle. \n\nLet me know if I missed any of your points, feel free to reach out if you have further questions as well.",

It seems like the D1 men's soccer team hosted tryouts in the beginning of Fall 2022 and Fall 2023 semesters, so it's possible they'll host tryouts for walk ons this Fall too. Didn't see any info about women's D1 team hosting tryouts. I doubt you'd get an athletic scholarship though, as they usually arent given out to walk ons.\n\nI'm sure the club team is easier to join, but you still probably have to be pretty good. If you're talking about the club team, then you'd want to check UMass Campus Pulse and search for mens/womens club soccer and then send them an email or DM on social media.",

Plus you can list them as animal experiences when applying for vet school. \n\nThe shuttles work well, as long as you show up on time. The TAs and professors are pretty good about setting up ride shares with classmates if the shuttles can't help. For example, the shuttle doesn't go to the Deerfield farm for belted Galloway management, so you'll end up getting rides from classmates. \n\nThey all have stuff that is outside the listed meeting times. Most of them have a rotating schedule of the students feeding the animals and doing basic animal maintenance, and then some sort of extra. Sheep had hoof trimming and lamb watch, poultry had 4H show practice, belted Galloway had heat checks, etc.   The professors are really good around scheduling these things around your other classes, but are less willing to work with things like work schedules. That being said, almost everyone in my classes were able to make jobs work around their schedules.\n\nHow difficult the actual class portions of the classes are varies, but overall they are pretty easy. They are intended for any year to be able to take them, so all of the concepts are explained from the ground up.",

And swipes can only be used as a whole swipe, you will be charged a full one whether you pick up $5 of food or the max of $13.25.  They do get you a full breakfast, lunch or dinner at a DC.  You can pay out of pocket at all locations including the DCs with cash, credit, debit, and UCard debit or dining dollars.\n\nMeal prices at the DCs are breakfast - $11.50, lunch - $15.50, and dinner - $18.75.  As an example, the YCMP 65 is $1067 for 65 swipes usable as a meal swipe at a DC or for $13.25 at the retail locations.  They also include $125 in dining dollars.  So in effect you are paying $14.50 per swipe and at the retail locations will only get $13.25 in value.

I\u2019m still working on telling myself that I am not old but just older than last year, lol\u2026.with time and right mindset it gets easier to \u201cage\u201d.    \n\nIn short it is not too old and neither is 70 if it will make you feel like you strived for and hopefully lived the life you wanted.\n \nFeel free to read below for my longer answer or dm. Made this burner just for you! You got this!!!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI still have a chip on my shoulder at times\u2026 about where I am and where I should be. People close to me say that I\u2019m brave for going back and trying to do something different. I sometimes feel brave and sometimes feel angry and sad. Just know the feelings come in waves! I applied to other schools to help me to feel positive about having a choice! \n\nIt feels great to know that I\u2019m studying something that I have a plan built around and I\u2019m not as \u201cunsure\u201d as I was straight out of HS. But it\u2019s okay if you are only 70% sure as long as you commit and finish, because there is always grad school if you want to study something else or go further\u2026.\n\nI\u2019ve found it\u2019s easier to  communicate with Professors and utilize resources (like office hours). Students mainly go right before a test, I avoid those times\u2026You should be going as much as you need, and at least once in the first month of school to build a relationship.\n\nI\u2019m not as scared about asking questions I don\u2019t know because 1) I\u2019m trying to do my best and stakes for me are higher 2) I realized often others are just as confused.. I used to think everyone was smarter than me (of course lots of people are) but after class I\u2019ve had people ask me for clarification on what i asked or they will say yeah I was confused about that topic as well. Most people don\u2019t ask questions but that\u2019s the only way (besides test grades) the Prof knows what people are soaking up.\n\nI live off campus. There are many towns surrounding Amherst that you can live. I decided to live in one of these places instead of Amherst proper, to be near people my age and with similar vibe. I can either drive or catch the bus to campus.\n\nI\u2019ve made some friends with grad students and some undergrads as well. You are allowed to join grad clubs and meet people that way. I prefer not to tell people my age including professors. If they ask I just say I\u2019m a few years older or I change the subject. People can and will treat you different based on age (on top of everything else). That\u2019s a fact of life and that can be positive or negative. I\u2019ve found most people assume you are their age but it may depend on your gender and style/look. I try to dress with the trends as to not stick out and obviously genetics and your environment affect the age you look. I don\u2019t smoke cigarettes, I use face lotion w/spf.",

It's absolutely not too old to get a degree or do a career change.\n\nAfter 27 you'll be 28, then 29, then you'll be 30 like me. It happens faster than you think it will. Ask yourself, do you want to be 30 with a degree? Or do you want to be 30 and stuck in the same position you're in now because you were too worried about being 'too old'?",

There are several programs I would love to take to further my education, but a part of me feels like 27 is too old to basically be a junior. Right now, I live 4.5 hours away from the college, so I would need to either dorm there or find off campus housing at the moment money is tight. Is 27 too old? Is there no point?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Overall they do seem kind and accepting, but J saw no students of color when I was there and talked to Catholic students of color who felt out of place. The church seems progressive on some issues, and echoes the Vatican's teachings on abortion and suicide. \n\nThe church community is pretty strong though, and I saw the same people at the center multiple times. I've heard that there is a very lively church community, although people tend to go during the week/at night and use the center as a hangout spot rather than attending early masses. \n\nI've also heard St. Brigid's downtown is nice, although it's definitely a much older crowd. I believe one of the priests from the Newman center also preaches there",

They will need to arrive at UMass next Monday or later, and you can't plan on picking them up before the RSD notifies you that the package is ready for pickup.  Considering it is the beginning of the semester and many packages are arriving for students next week, that could be several days after the package gets to UMass.  So don't send anything you would need right away.  There is a package size limit as well, 40 lbs or less.\n\nAs for getting into the building where the RSD is located, your Card may or may not be activated for the exterior door lock before your checkin and move-in date.",

That was for one 4 credit class. Most non stem students spend that much time a week on all of there courses. I averaged 35-40 hours a week especially my last 1.5 years(I did Chem E).
