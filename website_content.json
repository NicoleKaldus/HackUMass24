I compiled a list of my own personal experience in undergrad as well as information I think is the most important for incoming freshmen or transfers. Thank you to the people who added information to the document for stuff I missed :^) they\u2019re credited within this document.  There was originally a Google Doc for this information, but I moved it all here. This page will be more updated than that Google Doc. On this page, I will attempt to explain all of the stuff I have learned over the course of my years at UMass. This is not only limited to the computer science major (and honors college), but UMass in general. I hope this is useful in some capacity :) I will be answering everything in a Question/Answer format, but if I don\u2019t cover something please ask me. Please refer to the stickied table-of-contents to the right for sections on various topics.

        "content": " Before UMass     What are the important websites I need to know about or bookmark?     Moodle / MoonamiMost of your classes will have their class portal here. Similar to Canvas or Google Classroom if you\u2019re acquainted with those.  BlackboardSome classes will use this instead of Moodle.   Canvas  Most of your classes will have their class portal here. This is where you will view most of your course modules, important documents, etc. Starting in Fall 2024, Canvas was made the official learning management system (LMS). Previously, it used to accompany Moodle/Moonami and Blackboard .    SPIRE  Most of your UMass important things will be here, i.e. final exam schedule, class schedule, class enrollment, on-campus housing selection, UCard/Spire ID information, making roommate groups, etc\u2026.    GET  Website to view transaction history, UDebit balance, meal swipes left, Dining Dollar balance, etc. You can also deposit money into your UDebit balance here. There is also a mobile app called GET Mobile.    UMass Dining  Menu for every place on campus, includes the time they're open, where they are, etc. The mobile app (UMass Dining) also shows how busy an area is via livestream cameras.    Academic Calendar  Tells you the academic year calendar. Useful for checking what schedule we follow after academic holidays, when breaks are, etc.    UMass Amherst Zoom  If you need to login to a Zoom/online meeting with your UMass email, login here. It's very common for you to be unable to login to Zoom classes or recordings due to your default email on your browser not being your umass[dot]edu email, so you can login here.    Patient Portal  This is where you will put your immunizations and other vaccine information.    Navigate  This is where you will make advising appointments (graduate school, general guidance, honors requirements, major requirements, etc).    Gradescope  Some classes require you to use this to view your grades/submit things/view your feedback on assignments. This is used in CS and Math classes to my knowledge, not sure about others.    OWL  Another website for homework and tests to be assigned. I know that chemistry and other lab science classes use this.    Piazza  Online forum where students can ask questions about projects as well as receive notes/information from instructors of the course. CS students use this. Some teachers use something similar called Campuswire .         What apps are a good idea to download on my phone before coming?      GET App  View transaction history, UDebit balance, meal swipes left, Dining Dollar balance, etc. Reload your UDebit balance here.    UMass Dining  Menu for every place on campus, includes the time they're open, where they are, how busy it is, etc. If you have dietary restrictions, the ingredients for each dish is also listed and you can personalize your own menu based off your dietary restrictions (be careful regardless, it isn't super vigilant about reporting these things).    Transit or Google Maps  Bus schedule and routes.    UMass Amherst App  Has a bunch of shortcuts to aforementioned apps and websites (i.e. SPIRE, Calendar). Personally, I don't think it's very useful.    SpeedQueen  If you put in your residence hall, you can see which laundry machines (both washer and dryer) are currently occupied and how much time they have left until their cycles finish. Useful for when you need to do laundry and to figure out when there's machines free.         What are some other things I should do before coming?        Making friends with your peers would be useful (via Discord, Instagram, etc\u2026). Everyone's in the same boat as you and it would be nice to have someone to keep in touch with during the process.  Deposit some money into your UDebit account. Don't put too much, you really only need to put $20+ in at a time.            How do I get most of my UMass information and updates? What social medias can I follow or look at?      Your UMass email  Make sure to check it a lot.    r/umass  The UMass Amherst subreddit. There are a lot of people who ask a lot of questions there, so you can search a lot of things.

What is a minor? What is the purpose of one? How do I declare it?     A minor is to demonstrate interest or proficiency in some field. A lot of classes are restricted to the major that the course is for, but minors can get into some (i.e. art minors can take art major classes). You do not get a paper/diploma that says your minor when you graduate. First, you reach out to the department. You need to fill out a minor intent form for what department you\u2019re looking to minor in. If it gets approved, then you are good!   "

AP Credit is used to see if you can test out of classes. \u201cUMass Amherst grants advanced standing and/or credit for the College Board AP exams, but these credits will vary depending upon scores and subject matter. You may also receive credit for your SAT II Foreign Language scores. Official copies of your AP and/or SAT Subject Test scores shou ld be sent electronically to UMass Amherst.\u201d (Source) See this website to see if your test qualifies. You usually need a 3 or 4-5: here. See this one for SAT II: here.        What materials are required of each class? What is an access code?      SPIRE > Manage Classes > Classes & Finals Schedule > View My Classes > \"View/Purchase Textbooks\" button at the very top of the page. I would recommend waiting 'til close to the school semester start to see if you need to actually buy the textbooks, or even buy them after your first week of the semester. See the image below made by Andrew ('26) to see where the button is. An access code is a code that you input to some online portal to access your homework. This is pretty common for math classes. You need to buy the access code to access your homework Some of you guy might have heard about iClickers - An iClicker is a remote device that allows you to answer multiple choice questions during lectures (potential answers listed from A-E). DO NOT BUY AN ICLICKER IF YOU DO NOT NEED ONE! They are expensive devices, and sometimes the online iClicker website can act as a free substitute to the physical handheld device. I have only taken two CS classes that required an iClicker. Some classes and majors may vary, but do not buy if you do not need!         How do I take notes?      Depends on your major\u2026I personally like typing my notes as well as handwriting so I have a touchscreen laptop. I used to use Evernote and OneNote, but have since switched to Obsidian. Other (computer science) people recommend Notion, LaTeX, emacs, and neovim.         How do I know what classes I'm supposed to take?      At UMass, there's 2 different types of requirements you need to meet to graduate. You need to fulfill your major requirements as well as a set of general education requirements , or gen-eds for short. Major requirements depend on your major, and you can typically look up tracking or what classes you need to take for your major. Gen-eds are classes that everyone needs to take across many different general categories. If you're a CS major, I mention specifically what is needed later on in the Computer Science Major section.         I have specific interests and I want to take specific classes pertaining to my interests. What classes should I take?      Check this out         What are credits? What do they mean? How many do I have to take? What is my Academic Level based off my credits?      Credits are usually indicative of a course's workload. Typically, you will see 4-credit courses (these usually mean several lecture sessions and one discussion section per week). Some are 3 (no discussion section). Seminars are 1 credit. Depending on your major and how intensive it is/how many courses you have to take, you will choose x number of courses per semester. Talk to your advisor about this. See your \u201cAcademic Level\u201d based off your credits here . It depends on your total amount of credits, so your standing is based off the following: Freshman (0-26 credits), Sophomore (27-56 credits), Junior (57-86 credits), and Senior (87+ credits).         I came in with some credits for some classes (to my knowledge). How do I check if I actually got credit for it? How do I check where the rest of my requirements for gen-eds and major are?      SPIRE > Academics > General Academic Info > Academic Requirements (ARR). This page shows all the requirements that you have finished for your general education requirements, major requirements, and other requirements you may have (i.e. honors college). You can click the 'View Report as PDF' button at the top, scroll to the bottom, and find your AP/IB/etc... credit that you have from other places. Classes you have credit for will say 'CR' under the 'Grade' column.         How do I choose classes and enroll in classes? What is a shopping cart?      Choose classes based off your major requirements and general education requirements. The enrollment shopping cart is a way for you to \u201chold onto\u201d the classes you want to take before you actually enroll in them. You will have a hold on your account until your advising appointment which will not allow you to enroll in any classes until the appointment. There are 2 ways of looking for classes: via SPIRE or Schedule Builder.  Selecting classes  SPIRE : Add, Drop, & Edit Classes > Search for Classes (Advanced) > search by course number, category, etc... > click on a class > add to shopping cart  Schedule Builder : \"Add Course\" button > search for your classes > \"Generate Schedules\" button > select a schedule you like > \"Send to Shopping Cart\" button  Enrolling in courses  SPIRE : Add, Drop, & Edit Classes > Shopping Cart > check the checkbox for every class you want to enroll in > \"Enroll\" button      General Education Classes     What gen-eds do I need to take?      General Education/Academic Requirements You need to take a class that covers each category of gen-eds. The categories are: - College Writing (CW) - Junior Year Writing (JYW) - R1 - R2 - Biological Science (BS) - Physical Science (PS) - Art/Literature (AT/AL) - Historical Science (HS) - Social & Behavioral Science (SB) - +1 more class that is either AT/AL, HS, or SB - Diversity US (DU) - Diversity Global (DG) You can sometimes double up with 2 gen-eds for one class, but you'd need to look at the gen-eds that each class covers. I made a spreadsheet to track this as well as honors requirements: CS & HONORS REQUIREMENTS Gen-Ed Fulfillment Requirements and Expectations List of classes and what gen-ed categories they cover What is R1 and R2?

The DRCs were originally created by UMass Amherst students and today serve as living and learning communities that support personal growth and academic success. These communities are not restricted by major and are open to all sophomore, junior and senior students interested in the particular focus area. DRCs are an ideal choice for students who are looking for a dynamic, hands-on way to learn about the variety of cultures and lifestyles represented at UMass Amherst.\u201d (Source) These are saved for upperclassmen though usually.

You can eat at places like Blue Wall, Harvest Market (both of which are in the Campus Center) or the various cafes on campus. The cashier will ask you before you make your purchase.      Meal Plans & Meal Swipes     What are meal swipes? What meal plan do I choose?      To get into a dining hall and actually be able to get food, you need to tap your UCard and use a \u201cmeal swipe\u201d to get in. Dining halls are basically buffet-style, where you go to each station and get what food you want. Depending on your meal plan, that's how many meal swipes you will have.

Basically additional dining spending money that comes with some select meal plans that you can use at different places around UMass. There are places on campus that do not accept dining hall meal swipes that come with residential meal plans: Blue Wall (almost restaurant-style food), Harvest Market, and different Cafes around campus.
