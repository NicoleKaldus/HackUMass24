Of course I am willing to give school supplies for **free/cheaper price** if needed. Prices are based on what the current market price was that I looked up and based on what I paid for. Cash, BofA/Zelle, Cashapp, Venmo, Paypal. Note items like iclicker or certain electronics I will not hand them off till **END of semester,** but do not need to pay till you receive it . Any questions feel free to ask in comments or dm thank you!!\n\nIclicker 2 - New/Good Condition, $10\n\nDual Monitors WITH stand - Good/Fair condition  Dell 60hz 24in, this is an older model. Original price for each was $90. One of monitors has a black streak from bottom but doesn't go past half way in height, used it as a discord display, barely noticeable. Other monitor no streak. Asking for $65 for the better monitor but it wont have a stand with it because I do not have it with me (can look for it at home and hope my parents didn’t throw it out), if want both it will have the stand $125. Negotiable. DM if want video/proof. This does NOT include hdmi, dp cables.\n\nHyperX QuadCast Mic : Good Condition Original price: $100, Asking for $85, Negotiable.\n\nTi-84 scientific calculator: Older model, no led screen good/fair condition. Gets the job done. Asking for $60, Negotiable\n\n**Going to put this out there since I’m getting comments about my prices specifically about my monitors**.\xa0\n\n1. If y’all don’t like the prices and the monitor isn’t for you, that’s fine. I don’t know why y’all think I’m shoving prices and saying no it’s a set price. I even put the reason why I said it. So if I badly priced it you can simply just say hey lower this pls :)\xa0\n2. \xa0I even said multiple times, prices were negotiable.\xa0\n3. Goal was to make side money if I could. If I don’t sell that’s fine.\xa0Y’all can kindly scroll if this post isn’t for you.  Please don’t get nasty at me. \n4. I literally have used electronics like the mic and calculator and I even searched it up on Amazon/target what they were still selling for. And knocked it down. Did I also mention it could be free/lowered if needed? ",

There's also some gender neutral bathrooms on campus that are easier to change cups in when you're learning how to do it - my favorite is on the first floor of Machmer.
