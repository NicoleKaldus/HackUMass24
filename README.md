# Sam VS Goose - UMass Amherst Student Guide Chatbots

Welcome to our UMass Amherst Student Guide Webapp! This project was developed to help UMass Amherst students, especially newcomers, navigate campus life with ease. We have two specialized chatbots, **Sam the Minuteman** and **The Campus Pond Goose**, each offering valuable insights into different aspects of college life at UMass Amherst.

## Chatbots

### Sam the Minuteman üï∞Ô∏è
Sam the Minuteman is here to provide students with **official information** from the university. Whether you need details about campus events, academic resources, or policies, Sam is your reliable source, sharing only verified and university-provided information.

### The Campus Pond Goose ü™ø
The Campus Pond Goose offers a more **informal perspective** on campus life, sharing advice on the best dorms, classes, and dining spots based on student experiences and online discussions. As geese on campus overhear conversations daily, our Goose chatbot reflects real, unofficial insights that students have gathered and shared.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by our experience meeting freshmen at HackUMass, which reminded us of our own challenges navigating college life in the beginning. We wanted to create a resource that combines our knowledge in AI, databases, and cloud infrastructure to help new students settle in and thrive at UMass Amherst.

## Technology Stack

We used a range of powerful tools to bring this project to life:
- **OpenAI API**: Powers the chatbot responses with natural language understanding.
- **MongoDB**: Stores and manages chatbot data, ensuring smooth retrieval of relevant information.
- **Terraform**: Manages and automates our cloud infrastructure.
- **AWS**: Hosts our application and provides scalability for a seamless user experience.
- **Svelte**: Renders our frontend for a fast and responsive user experience.

## How It Works

1. **Sam the Minuteman** pulls official data from university resources and gives students accurate information directly from UMass Amherst.
2. **The Campus Pond Goose** aggregates unofficial insights, drawing from various sources around the web to provide a real student perspective.

Together, these chatbots aim to make the transition into college life easier, offering both formal and informal support as students explore UMass Amherst.
